Full text: Until Iran's barrage of missiles and drones against Israel, the two countries had avoided open military intrusions into each other's territory. Tehran most often acted through proxies, and Jerusalem via bombing runs and unacknowledged assassinations in the region.
Iran's unprecedented attack this weekend, which failed to kill a single Israeli, has perhaps now opened the clerical regime to a major reprisal. The White House clearly does not want Jerusalem to undertake such a response, fearing escalation that could bring the United States into a regional war.
But the chances are good that Israel will strike back to deter future direct attacks. And the best way for Washington to limit the expansion of this conflict is to signal clearly its intention to support an Israeli counterattack. It's the recurring military paradox: To contain a war, a belligerent sometimes needs to threaten its expansion. Iran's internal situation, its memory about past U.S. military action and a conspiratorial worldview all support this strategy.
An Iranian regime well aware of its weaknesses knows how convulsive a war with Israel and America would be and how unwelcome it would be received by a restive populace already protesting a dysfunctional economy and increasing oppression. Many within the elite are surely angry at having fallen from the inner circles of power and wealth as the 84-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, engineers his succession.
A powerful Israeli response could include a preventive strike against Iran's nuclear sites. In what may prove a miscalculation, Ayatollah Khamenei is not known to have given the green light to assemble a nuclear weapon. Why strike Iran hard and leave its atomic ambitions undamaged? Washington will surely want to reduce the consequences in the region from such an attack. To do that, the White House will need to make Tehran understand that U.S. forces will immediately intercede if Iran then tries to escalate.
To be sure, Israel and America may both be at fault for giving Ayatollah Khamenei the impression that they had no appetite for escalation. Tehran has abetted Islamic militants who have killed a lot of Israelis and Americans while seeming to be immune from a direct attack. The occasional Israeli and American assassination of Iranian military men on foreign soil, or in Iran without fanfare, actually highlighted a reluctance to confront Iran more directly.
And yet the Islamic Republic remains careful not to get into direct conflict with America. Senior clergy members and the commanders in the Revolutionary Guards are all old enough to remember that the U.S. Navy inflicted severe damage on the Iranian Navy in 1988 in retaliation for the mining of an American warship. It was one of the biggest U.S. naval operations since World War II. The United States said the downing in 1988 of Iran Air flight 655 by the Navy warship Vincennes was an accident, but Tehran believed it was deliberate and an indication that Washington was ready to intervene in the war with Iraq. It was thought to be a factor in helping to convince Iran to end the conflict. Senior Revolutionary Guardsmen, angry at Israel for the killing of senior commanders on April 1 in a strike in Syria, may doubt Washington's volition, but they have no doubts about American military hardware.
Sometimes conspiracy-mindedness, instead of interfering with clear thinking, can be useful to an adversary. It is a conceit of the Iranian Islamist elite that Jews manipulate Americans into wars not of their choosing. Ayatollah Khamenei has articulated this idea: "The Western powers are a mafia," he said in 2022. "At the top of this mafia stand the prominent Zionist merchants, and the politicians obey them. The U.S. is their showcase, and they're spread out everywhere."
It is time for Washington to feed this conspiratorial thinking. The United States should augment its presence in the Gulf, dispatch admirals and spy chiefs to Israel and undertake joint Israeli-U.S. military exercises that highlight long-range bombing runs. With its darkest conspiracies reconfirmed, Iran's elite will search for a way out -- even if Israel decides on a frontal assault.
The United States has often favored containment and de-escalation with Iran. When Iran's proxies killed three American service members in Jordan on Jan. 28, Washington didn't hold Tehran directly responsible. While attacking the proxies, the White House conveyed to Tehran its non-escalatory intentions. It had even renewed a sanctions waiver granting Iran access to $ 10 billion held in escrow by Oman for Iraqi electricity purchases.
The strategy has worked. Ayatollah Khamenei clamped down on his surrogates, who desisted from further attack on Americans. But the supreme leader can turn that spigot back on at any time.
Today, the problem with Washington distancing itself from Jerusalem, as it has over the large-scale civilian deaths and humanitarian suffering in the Gaza war, is that it will not defuse a crisis that puts Iran and Israel in direct confrontation. And Ayatollah Khamenei will not allow himself to be seen as backing down to Jews -- particularly if they are unmoored from superior American power.
For the United States, standing by Israel would allow Ayatollah Khamenei another path, a way to back down without losing face. There is a precedent for such a retreat. Again, the Iran-Iraq war is instructive. The founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ruhollah Khomeini, opted for an armistice with Iraq, a country he had long denigrated, because of the sheer exhaustion of his nation and the fear that the war could simply not be won. The implicit threat of American involvement was a big factor in this decision.
Now only the United States can again prompt similar foreboding in Tehran about the intercession of an indomitable force. For years Washington has been doing, more or less, just the opposite.

Full text: The Israeli war cabinet met again on Monday to discuss the strike, with some hawkish members of the prime minister's government calling for a swift and forceful retaliation.
Israel's war cabinet on Monday met to weigh possible responses to Iran's missile and drone attack over the weekend, as the United States, Britain and other allies strongly urged Israel to show restraint and sought to de-escalate tensions between the two regional powers.
Some far-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government called for a swift and forceful retaliation in response to Iran.
An Israeli official briefed on the cabinet discussions, speaking anonymously in order to talk about security matters, said several options were being considered, ranging from diplomacy to an imminent strike, but gave no further details. There was no immediate public statement by the ministers, or by the Israeli prime minister.
"We are weighing our steps," Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, told Israeli soldiers on Monday in televised remarks during a visit to an Israeli air base. "The launching of so many missiles, cruise missiles and drones toward Israeli territory will be responded to."
Mr. Netanyahu faces a delicate calculation -- how to respond to Iran in order not to look weak, while trying to avoid alienating the Biden administration and other allies already impatient with Israel's prosecution of the war in Gaza.
While the United States, Britain and France strongly condemned Iran's assault and stepped in to help thwart it on Saturday, their calls for restraint highlighted the pressure Israel was facing to avoid a more direct confrontation with Iran.
President Biden on Monday hailed the successful interception of Iran's airstrikes, which Iran carried out in retaliation for a deadly airstrike on an Iranian Embassy complex in Syria two weeks earlier.
"Together with our partners, we defeated that attack," Mr. Biden said in his first public appearance since the strikes, speaking from the Oval Office where he was hosting Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of Iraq.
"The United States is committed to Israel's security," he added, and was continuing to work toward a deal that would halt the war in Gaza, free the hostages there and prevent "the conflict from spreading beyond what it already has."
Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, noted on Monday that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had spoken to officials in Britain, Egypt, Germany, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey in an effort to ease tensions.
"We continue to make clear to everyone that we talk to that we want to see de-escalation, that we don't want to see this conflict further escalated," Mr. Miller told reporters in Washington. "We don't want to see a wider regional war."
Still, he added, "Israel is a sovereign country. They have to make their own decisions about how best to defend themselves."
As Israel considered its next move, Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, warned Israel again that, if attacked, Iran would "respond immediately to Israel's adventures."
"I reiterate that we are not seeking to increase tensions in the region," Mr. Amir Abdollahian said, according to Iranian state media. But he added that if American bases in the region were used in an attack, Iran would "have no choice" but to target those bases.
Mr. Amir Abdollahian spoke to his British counterpart, David Cameron, on Monday, amid the diplomatic efforts to prevent further military strikes.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain described Iran's attack as a "reckless and dangerous escalation" from a government that was "intent on sowing chaos in their backyard." Faced with such threats, "Israel has our full support," Mr. Sunak told British lawmakers. But he added that Britain was working with allies to de-escalate the situation, a point Mr. Cameron emphasized as well.
"We're urging our Israeli friends to be smart as well as tough, to use head as well as heart, not to strike back, but to recognize that actually Iran has suffered a tactical and strategic defeat and Israel should now focus on Hamas and making sure they get that hostage deal and that we try to bring peace and stability to Gaza," Mr. Cameron told the television program "Good Morning Britain."
His German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, went a bit further. Asked at a news conference on Monday whether Israel had the right to strike back, Ms. Baerbock said that "the right to self-defense means fending off an attack; retaliation is not a category in international law," The Associated Press reported.
"Israel won in a defensive way," she said, adding that "it is now important to secure this defensive victory diplomatically."
Nearly all of the more than 300 drones and missiles that Iran fired at Israel on Saturday were shot down by Israel's military with help from Britain, Jordan and the United States. The only serious casualty was a 7-year-old girl, Amina al-Hasoni, who was badly wounded.
On Monday, Iran said it was lifting airspace restrictions above Tehran, the capital, and reopening the domestic and international airports. In Israel, much of daily life returned to its usual rhythms, a day after the attack plunged the country into a state of anxiety.
In downtown Jerusalem, Jaffa Street was busy with shoppers and families out for a stroll at the start of a school break for the upcoming Passover holiday. Hip coffee shops and eateries in the fashionable German Colony neighborhood did a brisk business selling lattes and vegan lunch bowls.
On Tel Aviv's beachfront promenade, Lev Mizrach, 41, said he was taking the opportunity to enjoy some sunny peace and quiet while he could.
"For today, it seems we have a moment to rest," Mr. Mizrach said. "I am hopeful this thing with Iran is over, for now, because I am sick and tired of war."
Dana Ben Ami, 34, said she, too, hoped the crisis was over.
"Iran did what they needed to do," Ms. Ben Ami said. "Enough. We should all just stop now and call it a day and agree that it is over."
After more than six months of war in Gaza, she said, Israelis have little appetite for a new conflict with Iran.
"We have had enough of it all," she said. "It's time for Bibi to stop sending our husbands and sons to fight his wars," she added, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by a widely used nickname. "We are sick and tired of his government."
Israel's options range from openly striking Iran to not retaliating at all, a concession that some analysts said Israel could leverage to encourage further international sanctioning of Iran or the formalization of an anti-Iranian alliance.
There is a precedent for doing nothing: During the Gulf War of 1991, as Iraq lobbed Scud missiles at Israeli cities, Yitzhak Shamir, then Israel's hawkish prime minister, exercised restraint at the urging of the Bush administration to preserve the American-led coalition with friendly Arab states.
Israel could also revert to the ways of its yearslong shadow war with Iran, orchestrating some kind of bloodless cyberattack or relying on spy craft and covert actions against Iranian interests, inside or outside Iran, without claiming responsibility for them.
Israel's choice will have strategic implications for its war in Gaza against Hamas, which is funded and armed by Iran, and for Palestinian civilians who have been struggling for months with violence and severe hunger. More than 33,000 Gazans have been killed in the war, local health authorities say.
Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responded with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could incite a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.
In that case, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, in southern Gaza, where more than a million Palestinians have sought refuge. Israeli officials describe Rafah as Hamas's last stronghold.
"It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters," General Brom said.

Full text: Analysts feared Iran's strikes might set off a wider war. But with Israel still weighing its response, the attack's military and diplomatic consequences have yet to be determined.
The enormous salvo of Iranian weapons fired at Israel this weekend turned the countries' long-running shadow war into a direct confrontation, raising fears that the countries' old paradigm of trading carefully measured blows had been replaced by something more overt, violent and risky.
But by Monday, Israel had yet to respond to the Iranian assault. Rather than preparing the public for a showdown with its archrival, the government signaled a return to relative normalcy, lifting restrictions on large gatherings and allowing schools to reopen.
Some right-wing Israeli politicians, dismayed by the lack of an immediate response, have argued that Israel needs to strike back forcefully -- and soon -- or risk losing its deterrence. Other more centrist officials have argued that Israel should instead bide its time before responding and capitalize on the support it has received from allies and regional actors, who are otherwise angry about Israel's war in Gaza.
Any forceful Israeli response would risk angering President Biden, who has pressed Israel to de-escalate and whose military support Israel would need in the event of a major confrontation. Israel has already drawn the president's criticism for dragging out the war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel must now weigh the perceived benefits of retaliation against the risk of further displeasing the president, along with the potential cost -- both human and financial -- of fighting two wars at the same time.
An Israeli official briefed on cabinet discussions who requested anonymity to discuss security matters said that as of Monday several options were being considered, ranging from diplomacy to an imminent strike, but gave no further details.
In short, the next steps in the conflict remain uncertain.
The nature of Israel's response, analysts said, could increase or decrease the possibility of a regional war. And it could improve or strain Israel's ties with Arab nations that share an antipathy for Iran but have been critical of the war in Gaza.
It's also possible Israel and Iran simply return to well established norms of their shadow war -- with Israel assassinating individuals, Iran's proxies firing volleys at Israel and both sides trading cyberattacks.
"It's too early to tell," said Dana Stroul, who until recently was a senior Pentagon official with responsibility for the Middle East. "From an Israeli security perspective, it's hard to see how they can let it stand," Ms. Stroul said. "The question is: What does that look like and how can a clear line and signal be sent to Iran while avoiding World War III in the Middle East?"
If the trajectory of the coming days remains frustratingly opaque, the events of the past 48 hours have brought some new clarity to the conflict.
The weekend attack, in which Iran sent hundreds of exploding drones and missiles -- primarily from its own soil toward Israeli territory for the first time -- was in retaliation for Israel's killing of seven Iranian officials in Syria this month.
In military terms, the Iranian strikes signaled its willingness to confront Israel directly rather than through the use of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon, thereby upending Israel's assumptions about Iran's threshold for risk.
In diplomatic terms, Iran's strikes and Israel's robust defense of them, in coordination with Western and Arab partners, have helped shift international attention away from Israel's war in Gaza, where the reported death toll of more than 33,000 has prompted accusations, strongly denied by Israel, of genocide.
At a time when Israel's closest allies had become increasingly critical of the Israeli military's conduct in Gaza, Iran's attacks prompted those partners to work closely with the same Israeli Air Force that has carried out devastating strikes in Gaza.
"You can see that not just among the Arabs but also among the western Europeans, Israel's diplomatic standing is somewhat improved because it was a victim of Iranian aggression, not an aggressor," said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. "By being 'the victim,' it improves your position."
Analysts said that it remained unclear how Israel's defenses would function without the several days of warnings that Iran gave before its weekend attacks, which allowed Israel and its allies crucial time to prepare. And while Iran has said that any future Israeli "mistake" would be met with a "considerably more severe" response, that threat also remains untested and was vague enough to leave room to maneuver.
Should Israel fire back at Iran in a way that would drag the region into war, the good will Israel has recently accrued with its allies could quickly vanish, analysts said.
For Iran's leaders, the strikes, which caused limited damage and critically injured one child, were nevertheless a domestic and diplomatic victory because of the way they allowed Iran to present itself as standing up to Israel.
Domestically, Iran's leaders have had to face accusations that they had been too passive after previous attacks by Israel on Iranian officials. Analysts said the salvo also reassured Iran's allies and proxies in countries like Lebanon and Yemen that Iran was willing to bear the risk of attacking Israel from its own territory. And, they said, it allowed Iran to show up rival Middle Eastern leaders, who have publicly criticized Israel often while working quietly with its government.
Iran wants "to take the mantle of the protector of the Muslim world," said Narges Bajoghli, an Iran expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. "They're basically flexing their muscles for regional audiences and simultaneously showing the weakness of Arab leaders in the region," she said. "Arab nations have not confronted Israel in this direct way that Iran has."
The opposite was true: At least one Arab country, Jordan, was directly involved in repelling the Iranian strikes, and others are thought to have quietly assisted Israel either through sharing intelligence or sending data gathered from missile-detecting sensors.
Jordan, Israel's eastern neighbor, has a large Palestinian population and has regularly criticized the war in Gaza. But it still acknowledged that Iranian targets had been "dealt with" in Jordanian airspace and that its military would repel similar attacks in the future.
The announcement was a reminder of how, before the Gaza war, shared fears of Iran had begun to smooth Israel's diplomatic integration within the Middle East as well as allow greater military coordination between Israel and some Arab countries, including arms deals and joint training exercises.
For some Israeli analysts, this is why Iran's attack could yet help Israel's acceptance in the Middle East, even as its reputation plummets because of Gaza.
"The full details of how Sunni Arab regimes helped protect Israel, without doubt saving Israeli lives from Iranian missiles and drones, may not be known for a while. But this is a historic shift," wrote Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli commentator, in a column for Haaretz, a left-leaning newspaper. "Arab cooperation against the Iranian attack proves that the trend in the region is still toward an Arab-American-Israeli alliance against Iran and its proxies."
In particular, some hope it may give fresh momentum to U.S.-led efforts to seal diplomatic ties for the first time between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which seemed close to success before the Gaza war.
Saudi oil refineries came under attack in 2019 from the Houthis, an Iran-backed militia in Yemen. Riyadh seeks greater security cooperation with the United States to ward off similar aggression in the future -- an arrangement that the U.S. has indicated would likely be made only if Riyadh also formally recognized and worked with Israel.
But the chances of such a deal remain remote while the Gaza war endures and Israel's right-wing government shuns any discussion about creating a Palestinian state after the fighting ends -- a key Saudi demand.
"Diplomatically, I would seize on this and try to revive and invigorate regional cooperation," said Mr. Rabinovich, the former Israeli ambassador. "But the obstacle remains," he added. "What do you do with the Palestinian issue?"

Full text: In January 2020, Iran's top general, Qassim Suleimani, was killed near the Baghdad airport in a U.S. drone strike authorized by President Donald J. Trump. U.S. officials had accused General Suleimani -- the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' Quds Force, which conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran -- of causing the deaths of hundreds of soldiers during the Iraq war.
What followed his assassination was years of tit-for-tat exchanges of missiles and bombs between Iran-backed groups and U.S. forces in the region. Now, the Israeli airstrike that killed seven senior Iranian military officials in Syria earlier this month, and Iran's retaliatory assault this weekend, has elevated fears of a similar cycle of attacks and reprisals.
Just days after General Suleimani was killed, Iranian forces launched their opening salvo of retribution, firing 22 ballistic missiles at two American bases in Iraq.
Mr. Trump initially said that no U.S. troops had been wounded in the Iranian attack, but American officials later admitted that eight American service members had been evacuated for injuries. The number of Americans injured rose to 34, then to 50, then to 64 until defense officials said on Feb. 10, 2020, that 109 U.S. troops had been wounded.
American forces in Iraq and Syria have come under repeated attack from Iran-backed militias since then.
For President Biden, airstrikes on Iranian groups have been a nearly constant feature of his time in office.
Just over a month after Mr. Biden was inaugurated, he authorized the first in what has become a series of airstrikes against Iranian groups in the region in response to attacks on U.S. forces.
That airstrike, on Feb. 26, 2021, hit Iran-backed militia buildings in eastern Syria. It came in response to a rocket attack on an airport in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil that killed a Filipino contractor with the U.S.-led military coalition and wounded six others, including a Louisiana National Guard soldier and four American contractors.
This year on Jan. 28, three U.S. Army soldiers were killed and at least 40 service members were injured in a drone attack on an American military outpost in Jordan. They were the first known U.S. military fatalities from hostile fire in the turmoil spilling over from Israel's war with Hamas.
The Pentagon responded on Feb. 2 with airstrikes against seven sites linked to Iran in Syria and Iraq. Days later, the commander of the militia that American officials said was responsible for the attack in Jordan was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.
Since that strike, Tehran has exercised a degree of control over its proxy forces. But in the four previous months, the militia groups had launched more than 170 attacks against U.S. troops.

Full text: Iran's retaliation for Israel's killing of senior military leaders was a highly choreographed spectacle. But fears of a wider war still loom.
Iran's much-anticipated retaliation for Israel's killing of senior military leaders produced a fiery aerial display in the skies over Israel and the West Bank.
But in important ways, military analysts say, it was just that: a highly choreographed spectacle.
The more than 300 drones and missiles that hurtled through Iraqi and Jordanian airspace Saturday night before they were brought down seemed designed to create maximum drama while inflicting minimal damage, defense officials and military experts say. Just as they did back in 2020 when retaliating for the U.S. killing of Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iranian leaders this weekend gave plenty of warning that they were launching strikes.
Iran also sequenced the attack, a retaliation for airstrikes on an Iranian Embassy building in Syria on April 1, in such a way that both Israelis and Americans were able to adjust their aerial defenses once the Iranian missiles and drones were in the air.
The result: a lot of bang, but relatively little destruction on the ground.
Few of Iran's drones and missiles found their intended targets, an inaccuracy level that military experts and defense officials say was probably by design.
Iran planned the attacks in a way that would send a warning to Israel and create deterrence but avoid sparking a war, according to two members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said Iran gave countries in the region about 72 hours advance warning.
"I think Iran is very concerned about what comes next if they were too effective," said Gen. Joseph L. Votel, a former leader of the U.S. military's Central Command. "The early notification of what they were doing seems a little interesting to me."
The repercussions of such an immense aerial attack could still push Israel, Iran and even the United States closer to the wider war that President Biden has been trying to avoid. It was Iran's first direct attack on Israel after decades of a shadow war, and Israeli leaders were considering a possible response.
Mr. Biden has made clear to Israeli leaders that while the United States is committed to defending Israel, he has no interest in attacking Iran. In fact, the president and his team, hoping to avoid further escalation, are advising Israel that its successful defense against the Iranian airstrikes constituted a major strategic victory that might not require another round of retaliation, U.S. officials said.
In the space of five hours on Saturday night, Israel demonstrated that with the help of its allies, it could provide residents with solid protection from deadly airstrikes.
Israel's Iron Dome defense system, which became operational in 2011, intercepts rockets. But this weekend, Israel primarily used fighter jets and its Arrow 3 system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles outside the earth's atmosphere, including those armed with nuclear and other nonconventional warheads, a defense official said.
Iron Dome's interceptors are six inches wide and 10 feet long. They rely on sensors and computerized guidance to target short-range rockets. The Arrow system can fly longer distances to go after bigger threats.
Jacob Nagel, a former acting Israeli national security adviser, said Israel also used a system called David's Sling, which shoots down drones, missiles and rockets, and interceptions from Israeli warplanes.
The strikes were proof of concept for the Arrow 3 system, which had mostly been used to take down the occasional incoming missile fired by Houthi militia forces in Yemen. During the Iranian assault, the long-range system saw "more use than during the rest of its time since its invention put together," Mr. Nagel said. "And we saw that it works."
"The achievement as a whole is surprising," he added. "The Iranians never dreamed that we would intercept so many. They must have anticipated that a large chunk would be shot down, but they did not realize that 99 percent would be intercepted."
Mr. Nagel strongly rebuffed the idea, however, that Iran had not sought to inflict damage on their targets in Israel. "Symbolism is when you fire three or four rockets, not 320" drones and missiles, he said. "They fired all the varieties in their arsenal."
Israel got help from the United States, Britain and France. American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed four to six missiles, and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The more than 300 drones and missiles Iran launched was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.
Jordan, a critic of Israel's war effort in Gaza, said that its military had shot down aircraft and missiles that entered its airspace during the attack.
Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., a retired leader of Central Command, told CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday that Israel showed that it could defend its airspace, cities and people.
"So I think that Israel this morning is now much stronger than they were yesterday," he said.
On the surface, that would suggest that Iran came out weaker and showed that it still had a long way to go before it could make good on its leaders' frequent calls for the destruction of Israel.
But military analysts and defense officials cautioned about drawing firm conclusions about Iranian military capability from Saturday night's display.
Iran demonstrated that weapons fired from its territory could reach Israel, and for a foe with demonstrated nuclear ambitions, that capability should worry Israeli military strategists, General Votel, who led Central Command from 2016 to 2019, said in an interview.
"They can launch missiles that can reach Israel, even though they were shot down outside Israeli airspace," General Votel said. "It's concerning, particularly for a country that is pursuing nuclear weapons capability."
Afshon Ostovar, an expert on Iran's military at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., said that Iran showcased a large part of its military capability, but not all of it.
Many of Iran's drones were Shahed-136 "kamikazes," the same type that Russia is using in Ukraine. These are slow-moving and fly low, he said.
Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iran's military at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin, examined footage of the drones and missile launches published by media outlets affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, as well as photos of debris published by Israel, to determine the types of weapons that Iran used in the attack. Mr. Ostovar analyzed the attack from a strategic point of view, taking into account the weapons that were used.
Iran launched two types of long-range cruise and ballistic missiles, both developed by the Guards aerospace unit, both analysts said.
The cruise missile, called the Paveh, has a range of about 1,650 kilometers, or about 1,000 miles. It is the same type of missile that Iran has provided to the Houthi militia group in Yemen and to Shiite militant groups in Iraq. The ballistic missiles, they said, are called Emad and have a similar range.
Iran also used the Kheibar Shekan ballistic missile, one of its newest and most advanced. The precision-guided missile has a range of 1,450 kilometers, or about 900 miles. Iranian military officials have said its warhead can evade missile defense systems.
"The mix of weapons is what you would have expected in a substantial attack against Israel," Mr. Hinz said. "They have basically used their sophisticated system to conduct these strikes. Launching over 100 ballistic missiles over a short period of time is quite something, and doing a combined attack with that many different weapons is really the upper tier of potential actions they could do."

Linking Iran's Strike to What May Come Next in Gaza: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran might alter the war or affect a decision to invade the southern city of Rafah.
Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.
The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran's armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.
Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.
Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.
Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military's strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could incite a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.
In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.
"It's not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters," General Brom added.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military's plan to invade Rafah.
A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.
"There's an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse," he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.
While the members of Israel's war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault -- although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.
Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.
"There's no connection at all," said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.
General Gilead said that Israel's Army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.
Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.
"There's no real tension between these two things," said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council.
Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.
Though the United States, Israel's closest ally, has broadly supported Israel's decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.
While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.
"He says he wants to achieve 'total victory' in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months," he said, referring to the prime minister. "It's clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities."

Full text: The Iranian attack on Israeli territory made the Middle East's new reality undeniable: Clashes are getting harder and harder to contain.
Arab countries, from the United Arab Emirates and Oman to Jordan and Egypt, have tried for months to tamp down the conflict between Israel and Hamas, especially after it widened to include armed groups backed by Iran and embedded deep within the Arab world. Some of them, like the Houthis, threaten Arab governments as well.
But the Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel over the weekend, which put the entire region on alert, made the new reality unavoidable: Unlike past Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, and even those involving Israel and Lebanon or Syria, this one keeps expanding.
"Part of why these wars were contained was that they were not a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran," said Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute. "But now we are entering this era where a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran -- that could drag the region into the conflict and that could drag the U.S. in -- now that prospect of a regional war is going to be on the table all the time."
For the moment, the only countervailing force is the desire of both the United States and its longtime foe Iran to avoid a widening of the conflict, said Joost Hiltermann, the International Crisis Group's program director for the Middle East and North Africa.
"I am heartened by the fact that the only ones who want a war are Israel and Hamas," he said. "The Iranians are still talking to the Americans," he said, referring to messages sent in recent days between the two by intermediaries including Switzerland and Oman.
The Iranian message, said Mr. Hiltermann, made clear they were looking to demonstrate their power, not expand the war. "They said, 'There is going to be an attack, but we are going to keep it limited."'
Still, for citizens of Arab countries, many of whom watched scores of drones and missiles streaking across their skies on Saturday, professions of desire to avoid a wider war are a slender thread on which to hang their future. Dismay over the attack was evident in many public comments, and in private ones, too, though others celebrated it.
Officials and analysts in the region were divided over whether Iran's attack would spur countries with longstanding ties to the United States to push for still more engagement -- and security guarantees -- from Washington or to distance themselves in an effort to keep themselves safe from being attacked by Iran themselves.
Most urged de-escalation in the strongest terms. The only exceptions in the Arab world were northern Yemen, whose de facto Houthi government is close to Iran, and Lebanon, home to Hezbollah, the armed group backed by the Iranians.
Oman said that it was crucial to reach an immediate cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas that has been raging for the past half year in the Gaza Strip. Kuwait "stressed the necessity of addressing root causes" of the region's conflicts.
And Saudi Arabia, which has tried to cultivate relatively warm ties with Iran since the two countries re-established diplomatic relations last year, said it was "extremely concerned" about the dangerous implications of the military escalation in the region. A statement from its Foreign Ministry asked everyone involved "to exercise maximum restraint and to protect the region and its people from the dangers of war."
Even before the Hamas-led attack on Israel that set off the war in Gaza on Oct. 7, Arab countries had been adjusting their geopolitical relationships. Their concern was that they might no longer be able to count on a U.S. government increasingly focused on Asia as Iranian-backed armed groups became increasingly active.
Arab leaders' discomfort only increased with the Israeli assault in Gaza, which the United States defended but their own citizens found abhorrent, said Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program.
For Saudi Arabia, this meant forging a diplomatic relationship with Iran, despite their deeply held antagonisms and attacks carried out with Iranian missiles on Saudi infrastructure as recently as 2019. Saudi Arabia's approach to Iran was facilitated by China, which has recently worked to expand its influence in the region. Many Arab countries have turned to China in pursuit of business and diplomatic ties.
Then the war in Gaza began, dragging the Gulf states, along with Egypt and Jordan, more directly into the dynamics of a conflict they have wanted desperately to avoid.
Now, Jordan has found itself shooting down Iranian missiles -- and then being accused of defending Israel. The Israeli military assault on Gaza, often accused of being indiscriminate, has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, more than two-thirds of them women and children. Some 1,200 people were killed in Israel in the Hamas attack.
On Sunday, Jordan's government came under sharp criticism both at home and from neighboring Arab countries for shooting down at least one of the Iranian missiles aimed at Israel. A former Jordanian information minister, Samih al-Maaytah, defended the decision.
"Jordan's duty is to protect its lands and citizens," Mr. al-Maaytah said. "What Jordan did yesterday was to simply protect its airspace."
He also said that "Jordan's position on this conflict is that it is between two parties over influence and interests: Iran and Israel."
While the Gulf countries' petroleum exports have been largely spared, the Houthi attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea -- tied to the war in Gaza -- have raised costs and added to tensions.
It is unclear whether the conflict between Israel and Iran will strain further the relatively new ties between Israel and some Arab states. Since the war in Gaza began, those relations have cooled, but it seems none of the Arab governments that recently forged ties with Israel are ready to abandon them entirely.
Two of the countries that signed the Abraham accords normalizing relations with Israel in 2020 -- the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain -- have in some cases halted business deals or distanced themselves publicly from that country since the war in Gaza began. And Saudi Arabia, which had been exploring the possibility of diplomatic normalization with Israel, has insisted that any deal would require creating an "irreversible" pathway to a Palestinian state, an unlikely prospect in the current Israeli political climate.
That distancing is likely to continue, analysts say, but so far none have cut off relations with Israel or, in Saudi Arabia's case, completely ruled them out.
One reason Saudi Arabia has remained open to a future relationship with Israel is that now more than ever, the Saudis are hoping for a security guarantee from the United States in the event of an attack by Iran, said Yasmine Farouk, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington research group.
"What the Western countries under U.S. leadership have done to protect Israel yesterday is exactly what Saudi Arabia wants for itself," Ms. Farouk said.
She added that despite Saudi Arabia's history of enmity with Iran, the hardening of Saudi public opinion against Israel and the United States over the Gaza war is changing the calculations of Saudi leaders. Their focus is now on pushing the United States to compel Israel to end the war.
Perhaps the most striking development in the region is the growing push by some Arab countries to be part of forging diplomatic solutions to avoid having the region descend into a broader war. Arab countries held a conference in Riyadh in November to discuss how to best use their influence to stop the conflict.
Qatar and Oman have become ever more active behind the scenes in seeking to bring about a cease-fire in Israel and renew diplomatic efforts between Iran and the United States to prevent the outbreak of a destabilizing broader conflict.
Qatar's close relations with Hamas, Iran and the United States have made its ministers and senior officials pivotal in shuttle diplomacy. And Oman has become a conduit for messages between the United States and Iran. In just the past few days, Washington has communicated with Tehran through messages conveyed by the Omanis as well as the Swiss, according to a senior security official in Iraq and a senior U.S. administration official in Washington, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The new question, said Ms. Slim of the Middle East Institute, is what country can play the role of middleman and negotiator between Israel and Iran.
"The rules have changed, the red lines have changed and they need to be able to communicate," Ms. Slim said.

Full text: The U.S., Europe, Russia and China worked together on a 2015 deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. The arrangement's unraveling and the spike in superpower tensions make this a dangerous moment.
When Iran agreed to a deal in 2015 that would require it to surrender 97 percent of the uranium it could use to make nuclear bombs, Russia and China worked alongside the United States and Europe to get the pact done.
The Russians even took Iran's nuclear fuel, for a hefty fee, prompting celebratory declarations that President Vladimir V. Putin could cooperate with the West on critical security issues and help constrain a disruptive regime in a volatile region.
A lot has changed in the subsequent nine years. China and Russia are now more aligned with Iran's "Axis of Resistance" to an American-led order, along with the likes of North Korea. When President Biden gathered the leaders of six nations for a video call from the White House on Sunday to plot a common strategy for de-escalating the crisis between Israel and Iran, there was no chance of getting anyone from Beijing or Moscow on the screen.
The disappearance of that unified front is one of the many factors that make this moment seem "particularly dangerous," said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-born professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, "maybe the most dangerous in decades."
But it is hardly the only one.
President Donald J. Trump's decision to pull out of the Obama-era nuclear deal triggered a predictable counterreaction from Tehran, and after a long pause, Iran resumed enriching uranium -- some to near-bomb-grade quality. Today it is far closer to being able to produce bomb-grade material, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, than it was when the accord was in effect. Iran has consistently denied that it intends to build a weapon but has recently begun hinting at the need to bolster its "deterrent" against nuclear-armed adversaries.
Tehran has surged ahead with its ballistic missile program, and several months before some of those weapons were unleashed on Israel this weekend, all the remaining United Nations prohibitions expired. Iran has not only emerged as Russia's most dependable foreign supplier of military drones, but it has also improved its own drone fleet by drawing lessons from their use in Russia's assault on Ukraine.
President Barack Obama's pursuit of the 2015 nuclear deal was assailed by many Republicans as dangerously irresponsible at the time. Even some Democrats, though supportive of the details of the deal, worried that Mr. Obama was naïve to hope it would bring about fundamental change in Tehran.
With the latest escalation of tensions between Iran and Israel, Mr. Biden's political opponents are now blaming the administration for having not taken a tougher line in recent years against Iran. They say that has left Israel in particular peril at a moment when it is mired in a war against an Iranian client group, Hamas, in Gaza.
"The White House signaled both obliviousness and weakness by not recognizing that today's Middle East conflict is not Palestinians or Arabs against Israel, but an Iranian war against 'the little Satan,"' John R. Bolton, who served as national security adviser to Mr. Trump and was a sharp opponent of the Iran deal, wrote on Sunday.
"The sad truth is that Israeli and U.S. deterrence against Iran failed," he said. He went on to urge -- as he and a small group of Iran hawks have before -- that the Israelis seize the moment to "destroy Iran's air defenses" and perhaps go after the Quds Force, Iran's most elite units. In other words, take a course of escalation exactly the opposite of what Mr. Biden is urging.
Even among experts more supportive of Mr. Biden's diplomacy in the region, many are concerned that now there are few levers to influence Iran, especially if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel responds to the attack with a more calibrated retaliatory strike than the one Mr. Bolton is urging.
"We appear to be headed to an eventual Israel-Iran confrontation," Mr. Nasr said.
"Iran and Israel are now the main protagonists in the Middle East," he added. "They view each other as their most serious national security threats. There are no red lines or rules in place to contain their rivalry. The shadow war is now breaking into the open, and without some rules, they are on an escalatory path."
This was not the world Mr. Biden hoped for as he designed a strategy for his administration that focused on containing Russia's disruptions in Ukraine and beyond, and competing vigorously with China. And in the first three years of Mr. Biden's presidency, the Middle East seemed relatively calm, until the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis, upended his priorities and plunged the White House back into a familiar cauldron.
While Mr. Biden used intermediaries to help assure that Iran's retaliatory strikes over the weekend did not spin out of control -- and Iran appeared intent on keeping indirect lines open -- there is no direct communication between Washington and Tehran, a major change from even a decade ago. During the Iran negotiations, Secretary of State John F. Kerry spoke regularly, and directly, to his Iranian opposite number, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who had attended college and graduate school in the United States before the Iranian revolution.
As they haggled over the number of centrifuges Iran could build, they also defused potential crises. When a small American naval vessel accidentally crossed into Iranian waters and its crew was seized, calls between the two men got them released in hours, averting another hostage crisis.
But that era is over. When the Biden administration came in, and sought in its first 18 months to revive some part of the 2015 deal, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared that there would be no direct talks with the administration. Notes and offers were passed through European interlocutors. The two sides seemed at the cusp of a deal in the summer of 2022; the Iranian negotiators took it back to Tehran, where new demands were added and the entire process fell apart.
Now the fear of a general escalation has a new, lurking nuclear dimension.
The Iranians have not, from all available evidence, been racing for a bomb; their progress in uranium enrichment has been steady and deliberate. But as part of the pressure campaign on the West, they have largely blinded inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world's nuclear watchdog.
Inspectors have been barred from some sites. Some inspectors, from countries the Iranians have deemed unfriendly, have been denied entry. Surveillance cameras at some crucial sites have been removed. Questions about past activity at specific military locations have gone unanswered.
"The result is that I cannot offer assurances" that nuclear material has not been diverted to other facilities or weapons programs, Rafael M. Grossi, the Argentine diplomat who serves as director general of the United Nations agency, said in an interview before the outbreak of the missile barrage over the weekend.
Nuclear experts say one of their biggest concerns today is that Iran has every incentive to proceed with its nuclear program, both to taunt the West and to build what it always calls its "deterrent" against Israel, the undeclared nuclear weapons state in the region.
"That's my concern -- they have every motivation to accelerate," James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence under Mr. Obama, said on Sunday.
Other experts note that Israel's success -- with American help -- in shooting down almost all of the drones and ballistic missiles fired from Iran overnight on Saturday could well lead Iranian military officials to conclude they need more powerful weapons, stationed closer to Israeli territory. And they may conclude that their logical next step is to move -- overtly or covertly -- toward a nuclear weapon.
For now, Mr. Biden is doing everything he can to persuade Mr. Netanyahu, with whom his relationship is fraught, to "take the win," as he put it to him Saturday night, and not retaliate.
For their part, the Iranians have signaled that in their mind, the incident is over. They have avenged the deaths from an Israeli strike of seven commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. But "over" could simply refer to an end to the missile barrage, not other forms of escalation.
The best scenario would be that Iran recognizes the danger as well, as it did on Saturday when it carefully telegraphed its intentions, which made it far easier for the Israelis, the Americans and nearby Arab forces to intercept the incoming drones and missiles. That was a sign that Iran wanted to make a point, but may not be ready to go to the brink of war.

Israel’s war Cabinet met Monday to weigh possible responses to Iran’s missile and drone attack over the weekend, as the United States, Britain and other allies strongly urged Israel to show restraint and sought to de-escalate tensions between the two regional powers.
Some far-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government called for a swift and forceful retaliation in response to Iran.
An Israeli official briefed on the Cabinet discussions, speaking anonymously in order to talk about security matters, said several options were being considered, ranging from diplomacy to an imminent strike, but gave no further details. There was no immediate public statement by the ministers, or by the Israeli prime minister.
“We are weighing our steps,” Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, told Israeli soldiers Monday in televised remarks during a visit to an Israeli air base. “The launching of so many missiles, cruise missiles and drones toward Israeli territory will be responded to.”
Netanyahu faces a delicate calculation: how to respond to Iran in order not to look weak, while trying to avoid alienating the Biden administration and other allies already impatient with Israel’s prosecution of the war in the Gaza Strip.
While the United States, Britain and France strongly condemned Iran’s assault and stepped in to help thwart it Saturday, their calls for restraint highlighted the pressure Israel was facing to avoid a more direct confrontation with Iran.
President Joe Biden on Monday hailed the successful interception of Iran’s airstrikes, which Iran carried out in retaliation for a deadly airstrike on an Iranian Embassy complex in Syria two weeks earlier.
“Together with our partners, we defeated that attack,” Biden said in his first public appearance since the strikes, speaking from the Oval Office where he was hosting Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani of Iraq.
“The United States is committed to Israel’s security,” he added, and was continuing to work toward a deal that would halt the war in Gaza, free the hostages there and prevent “the conflict from spreading beyond what it already has.”
Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesperson, noted Monday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken had spoken to officials in Britain, Egypt, Germany, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey in an effort to ease tensions.
“We continue to make clear to everyone that we talk to that we want to see de-escalation, that we don’t want to see this conflict further escalated,” Miller told reporters in Washington. “We don’t want to see a wider regional war.”
Still, he added: “Israel is a sovereign country. They have to make their own decisions about how best to defend themselves.”
As Israel considered its next move, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, warned Israel again that, if attacked, Iran would “respond immediately to Israel’s adventures.”
“I reiterate that we are not seeking to increase tensions in the region,” Amirabdollahian said, according to Iranian state media. But he added that if American bases in the region were used in an attack, Iran would “have no choice” but to target those bases.
Amirabdollahian spoke to his British counterpart, David Cameron, on Monday amid the diplomatic efforts to prevent further military strikes.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain described Iran’s attack as a “reckless and dangerous escalation” from a government that was “intent on sowing chaos in their backyard.” Faced with such threats, “Israel has our full support,” Sunak told British lawmakers. But he added that Britain was working with allies to de-escalate the situation, a point Cameron emphasized as well.
“We’re urging our Israeli friends to be smart as well as tough, to use head as well as heart, not to strike back, but to recognize that actually Iran has suffered a tactical and strategic defeat and Israel should now focus on Hamas and making sure they get that hostage deal and that we try to bring peace and stability to Gaza,” Cameron told the television program “Good Morning Britain.”
His German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, went a bit further. Asked at a news conference Monday whether Israel had the right to strike back, Baerbock said that “the right to self-defense means fending off an attack; retaliation is not a category in international law,” The Associated Press reported.
“Israel won in a defensive way,” she said, adding that “it is now important to secure this defensive victory diplomatically.”
Nearly all of the more than 300 drones and missiles that Iran fired at Israel on Saturday were shot down by Israel’s military with help from Britain, Jordan and the United States. The only serious casualty was a 7-year-old girl, Amina al-Hasoni, who was badly wounded.
On Monday, Iran said it was lifting airspace restrictions above Tehran, the capital, and reopening the domestic and international airports. In Israel, much of daily life returned to its usual rhythms a day after the attack plunged the country into a state of anxiety.
In downtown Jerusalem, Jaffa Street was busy with shoppers and families out for strolls at the start of a school break for the coming Passover holiday. Hip coffee shops and restaurants in the fashionable German Colony neighborhood did a brisk business selling lattes and vegan lunch bowls.
On Tel Aviv’s beachfront promenade, Lev Mizrach, 41, said he was taking the opportunity to enjoy some sunny peace and quiet while he could.
“For today, it seems we have a moment to rest,” Mizrach said. “I am hopeful this thing with Iran is over, for now, because I am sick and tired of war.”
Dana Ben Ami, 34, said she, too, hoped the crisis was over.
“Iran did what they needed to do,” Ben Ami said. “Enough. We should all just stop now and call it a day and agree that it is over.”
After more than six months of war in Gaza, she said, Israelis have little appetite for a new conflict with Iran.
“We have had enough of it all,” she said.
“It’s time for Bibi to stop sending our husbands and sons to fight his wars,” she added, referring to Netanyahu by a widely used nickname. “We are sick and tired of his government.”
Israel’s options range from openly striking Iran to not retaliating at all, a concession that some analysts said Israel could leverage to encourage further international sanctions against Iran or the formalization of an anti-Iranian alliance.
There is a precedent for doing nothing: During the Persian Gulf War of 1991, as Iraq lobbed Scud missiles at Israeli cities, Yitzhak Shamir, then Israel’s hawkish prime minister, exercised restraint at the urging of the George H.W. Bush administration to preserve the U.S.-led coalition with friendly Arab states.
Israel could also revert to the ways of its yearslong shadow war with Iran, orchestrating some kind of bloodless cyberattack or relying on spy craft and covert actions against Iranian interests, inside or outside Iran, without claiming responsibility for them.
Israel’s choice will have strategic implications for its war in Gaza against Hamas, which is funded and armed by Iran, and for Palestinian civilians who have been struggling for months with violence and severe hunger. More than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the war, local health authorities say.
Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military’s strategic planning division, said that if Israel responded with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could incite a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.
In that case, Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, in southern Gaza, where more than 1 million Palestinians have sought refuge. Israeli officials describe Rafah as Hamas’ last stronghold.
“It’s not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,” Brom said.

The Russians even took Iran’s nuclear fuel, for a hefty fee, prompting celebratory declarations that Russian President Vladimir Putin could cooperate with the West on critical security issues and help constrain a disruptive regime in a volatile region.

“The White House signaled both obliviousness and weakness by not recognizing that today’s Middle East conflict is not Palestinians or Arabs against Israel, but an Iranian war against ‘the little Satan,’” John Bolton, who served as national security adviser to Trump and was a sharp opponent of the Iran deal, wrote Sunday.
“The sad truth is that Israeli and U.S. deterrence against Iran failed,” he said. He went on to urge — as he and a small group of Iran hawks have before — that Israelis seize the moment to “destroy Iran’s air defenses” and perhaps go after the Quds Force, Iran’s most elite units. In other words, take a course of escalation exactly the opposite of what Biden is urging.
Even among experts more supportive of Biden’s diplomacy in the region, many are concerned that now there are few levers to influence Iran, especially if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responds to the attack with a more calibrated retaliatory strike than the one Bolton is urging.
“We appear to be headed to an eventual Israel-Iran confrontation,” Nasr said.
“Iran and Israel are now the main protagonists in the Middle East,” he added. “They view each other as their most serious national security threats. There are no red lines or rules in place to contain their rivalry. The shadow war is now breaking into the open, and without some rules, they are on an escalatory path."
This was not the world Biden hoped for as he designed a strategy for his administration that focused on containing Russia’s disruptions in Ukraine and beyond, and competing vigorously with China. And in the first three years of Biden’s presidency, the Middle East seemed relatively calm, until the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis, upended his priorities and plunged the White House back into a familiar cauldron.
Although Biden used intermediaries to help ensure that Iran’s retaliatory strikes over the weekend did not spin out of control — and Iran appeared intent on keeping indirect lines open — there is no direct communication between the U.S. and Iran, a major change from even a decade ago.
During the Iran negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke regularly, and directly, to his Iranian opposite number, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who had attended college and graduate school in the United States before the Iranian revolution.
As they haggled over the number of centrifuges Iran could build, they also defused potential crises. When a small U.S. naval vessel accidentally crossed into Iranian waters and its crew was seized, calls between the two men got them released in hours, averting another hostage crisis.
But that era is over. When the Biden administration came in, and sought in its first 18 months to revive some part of the 2015 deal, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared that there would be no direct talks with the administration. Notes and offers were passed through European interlocutors. The two sides seemed at the cusp of a deal in the summer of 2022; the Iranian negotiators took it back to Tehran, where new demands were added and the entire process fell apart.
Now, the fear of a general escalation has a new, lurking nuclear dimension.
The Iranians have not, from all available evidence, been racing for a bomb; their progress in uranium enrichment has been steady and deliberate. But as part of the pressure campaign on the West, they have largely blinded inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world’s nuclear watchdog.
Inspectors have been barred from some sites. Some inspectors, from countries the Iranians have deemed unfriendly, have been denied entry. Surveillance cameras at some crucial sites have been removed. Questions about past activity at specific military locations have gone unanswered.
“The result is that I cannot offer assurances” that nuclear material has not been diverted to other facilities or weapons programs, Rafael Grossi, the Argentine diplomat who serves as director general of the United Nations agency, said in an interview before the outbreak of the missile barrage over the weekend.
Nuclear experts say one of their biggest concerns today is that Iran has every incentive to proceed with its nuclear program, both to taunt the West and to build what it always calls its “deterrent” against Israel, the undeclared nuclear weapons state in the region.
“That’s my concern — they have every motivation to accelerate,” James Clapper, director of national intelligence under Obama, said Sunday.
Other experts note that Israel’s success — with U.S. help — in shooting down almost all of the drones and ballistic missiles fired from Iran overnight Saturday could well lead Iranian military officials to conclude they need more powerful weapons, stationed closer to Israeli territory. And they may conclude that their logical next step is to move — overtly or covertly — toward a nuclear weapon.
For now, Biden is doing everything he can to persuade Netanyahu, with whom his relationship is fraught, to “take the win,” as he put it to him Saturday night, and not retaliate.
For their part, the Iranians have signaled that in their mind, the incident is over. They have avenged the deaths from an Israeli strike of seven commanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. But “over” could simply refer to an end to the missile barrage, not other forms of escalation.
The best scenario would be that Iran recognizes the danger as well, as it did Saturday when it carefully telegraphed its intentions, which made it far easier for the Israelis, the U.S. and nearby Arab forces to intercept the incoming drones and missiles. That was a sign that Iran wanted to make a point but may not be ready to go to the brink of war.

Full text: The president told Israel that the interception of nearly all of the Iranian drones and missiles used to attack it constituted a major victory, and so further retaliation might not be necessary, U.S. officials said.
President Biden and his team, hoping to avoid further escalation leading to a wider war in the Middle East, are advising Israel that its successful defense against Iranian airstrikes constituted a major strategic victory that might not require another round of retaliation, U.S. officials said on Sunday.
The interception of nearly all of the more than 300 drones and missiles fired against Israel on Saturday night demonstrated that Israel had come out ahead in its confrontation with Iran and proved to enemies its ability to protect itself along with its American allies, meaning it did not necessarily need to fire back, the officials said.
Whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government will agree to leave it at that was not yet clear as the country's war cabinet met for several hours on Sunday to make decisions about its next steps.
The leaders of the Group of 7 major industrial democracies echoed Mr. Biden's message on Sunday morning, condemning Iran for the attack and warning that it could provoke what they called an "uncontrollable regional escalation" in the Middle East.
"This must be avoided," the joint statement said. "We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation."
Although damage from the attack was relatively light, the scope of the strikes went well beyond the small-bore tit-for-tat shadow war between Iran and Israel in recent years, crossing a red line with the firing of weapons from Iranian territory into Israeli territory. Had defenses not held, scores or hundreds could have been killed.
American officials said it was clear to them that wide-scale death was Iran's intent, despite the fact that its leadership telegraphed the attack well in advance, publicly and privately. Officials said that even as the attack was underway, Iran's government sent word through Swiss intermediaries that it considered the matter closed.
"I mean, look at the size and the scale, the scope of what they fired into Israel from Iran proper: more than 300 missiles and drones," John F. Kirby, the national security spokesman at the White House, said on Sunday on CBS News's "Face the Nation." "They wanted to cause damage -- no question about that. But they were utterly unsuccessful in doing so."
Emotions were running high among Israeli officials during phone calls with American partners late into the night, and the pressure to fire back was consequently strong. The U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions, stressed that the decision about whether and how to respond was ultimately up to Israel.
Israeli jets early on Sunday hit structures in Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah after the Iranian-backed militia sent two explosive drones into Israel, but it was not clear how related that was to the Iranian airstrike.
Mr. Biden spoke with Mr. Netanyahu on Saturday after the Iranian attack and repeated his "ironclad commitment" to Israel's security. Mr. Biden urged restraint, telling Mr. Netanyahu that it was time to "think carefully and strategically" about the risks of escalation if the Israelis respond in kind with military force, according to one senior administration official.
In a statement released after the call, Mr. Biden hinted publicly at a desire for actions that would not continue a cycle of retribution.
"I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks -- sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel," Mr. Biden said.
"Taken together, @JoeBiden's message is designed to gently persuade #Israel not to pursue further escalation," Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote on social media.
That is likely to generate criticism of Mr. Biden from conservatives, some of whom quickly went public urging a powerful military reprisal against Iran -- not only by Israel, but by the United States, as well. "We must move quickly and launch aggressive retaliatory strikes on Iran," Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement posted online.
Speaker Mike Johnson partly blamed the Biden administration for the Iran strike because of what he called its "undermining of Israel and appeasement of Iran." He did not mention that he himself has so far failed to permit a floor vote on bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate providing security aid to Israel and Ukraine. Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican leader, said that "in light of Iran's unjustified attack on Israel," the House this week would consider aid to Israel, but he gave no details. Mr. Johnson also said on Sunday that the House would take up Israel aid in the coming days.
The eruption between Israel and Iran came at a time of great tension between Mr. Biden and Mr. Netanyahu. In a call only 10 days ago, the president threatened to rethink his support for Israel's war in Gaza if Mr. Netanyahu did not do more to alleviate civilian suffering in the enclave, leveraging American backing for the first time since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.
At the same time the two leaders clashed, Israel had just executed an airstrike against the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing seven Iranian officers involved in covert operations in a move that threatened the escalation that Mr. Biden had long feared. Even so, the president made clear that his support for Israel's security was still unwavering and warned Iran not to respond.
American and Israeli officials spent the past few days coordinating military operations in case Iran did act, and Mr. Biden ordered aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region. Even as the attack began, Michael Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, and the Israeli defense attaché were meeting with officials at the White House to coordinate the response to the attack.
Administration officials were elated at the results as U.S. and Israeli forces knocked down nearly everything thrown at Israel, including more than 100 ballistic missiles, a feat that one official said might be unmatched in military history. Jordan intercepted projectiles crossing its airspace, saying it was guarding its own security.
American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed four to six ballistic missiles and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The number of drones and missiles that Iran launched -- more than 300 -- was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.
On Sunday morning, Mr. Biden spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan about the attack and called two members of the 494th and 335th fighter squadrons to praise them for the successful mission.
Even though Iran did little tangible damage, it signaled after the strikes that it was ready to stand down -- and clearly hoped to avoid direct engagement with the United States. "The matter can be deemed concluded," the Iranian mission to the United Nations said in a statement. "However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!"
The situation was reminiscent of January 2020, when President Donald J. Trump ordered an airstrike in Iraq to kill Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who led the powerful Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at well-defended U.S. bases in Iraq with relatively little damage, though about 100 U.S. military personnel were wounded. It then sent a private message saying it was done. Mr. Trump chose not to retaliate, and fears of a cycle of escalation faded.
In the days leading up to the attack on Saturday, Mr. Netanyahu warned Tehran not to act, saying, "Whoever hurts us, we hurt them." But because Israel was not badly hurt, Mr. Netanyahu may have some room to declare victory and move on. Israeli officials were not clear on their intentions.
"The campaign is not over yet -- we must remain alert and attentive to the instructions published by the I.D.F. and Homefront Command," said Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. "We must be prepared for every scenario. Having said this, we have thwarted the most significant wave" of the attack, "and we did so successfully."
The American argument was that because Israel also successfully took out those senior Iranian officers in Damascus two weeks ago without paying a significant price, another round of military action could be deemed unnecessary.

Iran Just Made a Big Mistake. Israel Shouldn't Follow.: [Op-Ed]

Full text: It would be easy to be dazzled by the way Israeli, American and other allied militaries shot down virtually every Iranian drone, cruise missile and ballistic missile launched at Israel on Saturday and conclude that Iran had made its point -- retaliating for Israel's allegedly killing a top Iranian commander operating against Israel from Syria -- and now we can call it a day.
That would be a dangerous misreading of what just happened and a huge geopolitical mistake by the West and the world at large.
There now needs to be a massive, sustained, global initiative to isolate Iran -- not only to deter it from trying such an adventure again but also to give reason to Israel not to automatically retaliate militarily. That would be a grievous error, too. Iran has a regional network, and Israel needs a regional alliance, along with the U.S., to deter it over the long run.
So there must be major diplomatic and economic consequences for Iran, with countries like China finally stepping up: When Tehran fired all those drones and missiles, it could not know that virtually all of them would be intercepted. Some were shot down over Jerusalem. A missile could have hit al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest shrines. (You can see pictures online of Iranian rockets being intercepted in the skies right over the mosque.) Another could have hit the Israeli Parliament or a high-rise apartment house, causing massive casualties.
In other words, we are talking about an escalation without precedent in the long-running, tightly contained, shadow war between Iran and Israel that had almost exclusively been limited to targeted Israeli strikes against Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps units in Lebanon and Syria -- where they have no business being in the first place -- and Iran retaliating by having its Lebanese proxy militia, Hezbollah, fire rockets at Israel. We've also seen Iran smuggling arms and explosives from Syria into Jordan, Gaza and the West Bank to be used to kill Israelis and destabilize Jordan -- and the Mossad assassinating a nuclear scientist inside Iran.
But Israel has never launched such a massive missile strike directly at Iran, and Iran had never done so to Israel, either, before this. Indeed, no country had attacked Israel directly since Saddam Hussein's Iraq did with Scud missiles 33 years ago. Without a U.S.-led global initiative to impose sanctions on Iran and further isolate it on the world stage, Iran's behavior would be tacitly normalized, in which case Israel will most likely retaliate in kind and we're on our way to a major Middle East war and $ 250-a-barrel oil.
"The alternative to a wider full-scale regional war, which we don't want and Israel doesn't want, cannot be a return to the status quo ante," Nader Mousavizadeh, the founder and C.E.O. of the geopolitical consulting firm Macro Advisory Partners and a senior adviser to Kofi Annan when he was the U.N. secretary general, told me. A global effort to isolate Iran, Mousavizadeh added, "is the best way to separate the regime from its people, reassure Israel and Israelis of their security and remove the need for further regional military escalation, which would be a gift to Iran and its proxies."
It is also the best way to ensure that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel does not drag the United States into a regional war to shore up his own crumbling political base.
It is impossible to exaggerate the political-military implications of what just happened. Shortly after the missile strike, President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran issued a statement declaring that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had "taught a lesson to the Zionist enemy." It sure did, but it may not be the one Raisi thinks.
Iran just unwittingly revealed to the whole world that Iran's government is so penetrated by Western espionage agencies (because so many Iranians hate their own government) that President Biden was able to predict almost the exact hour of attack over a day in advance, and it showed the whole world that Israel and its Western allies have far superior antimissile capabilities than Iran has missile capabilities.
As the Haaretz veteran military correspondent Amos Harel wrote Sunday: We are talking about "an unprecedented achievement in the history of Israel's wars -- albeit with some help from friends -- that largely takes away the main card held by Iran and the axis: drones and missiles. The impressive Arrow system interceptions have garnered most of the attention, but Israeli and American pilots downed hundreds of cruise missiles and drones."
One has to assume that Iran and its proxies have to be both disappointed and unnerved by this turn of events. As Harel added: "The Iranian intention, as evaluated ahead of the attack, was to put on a display of its capabilities with an attack on military targets. An analysis of the areas in which warnings were sounded suggests the target could have been the Nevatim air base in southern Israel. It appears that the Iranians planned to destroy the base and the advanced F-35 fighter jets stationed there, which are the crown jewel of American aid to Israel. Iran failed completely."
Instead, the Iranian attack may have been limited to badly wounding a 7-year-old Israeli Muslim Bedouin girl hit by falling shrapnel. And if that's how effective Iran's offense was, its leaders have to now be wondering how good its defenses are -- if Israel now chooses to retaliate. Hezbollah has to be asking the same.
That may explain why Raisi, after his boast about teaching Israel a lesson, asked (pleaded?) that the U.S. and all other "supporters of the occupying regime ... appreciate this responsible and proportionate action by the Islamic Republic of Iran" and not go on the offensive against Iran. Message to the world from Tehran: We were just sending a little warning shot, nothing to worry about here, let's move on.
That is not only because Raisi is worried about his external front. Early this month, Haaretz reported that "Iranian soccer fans in Tehran's Aryamehr Stadium were asked to observe a minute of silence in honor of the seven members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, including top general Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who were killed in [the Israeli] airstrike on its consulate in Damascus. Instead, spectators began booing and blowing air horns in an apparent act of protest. In a video circulating on social media, fans can be seen loudly interrupting the moment of silence. ... In one video that made the rounds on X, fans can be seen shouting, 'Take that Palestinian flag and shove it up your ass!"' And this is not the first time it's happened at football matches.
Many Iranians understand that the regime's obsession with destroying the Jewish state is nothing but a costly way to divert the Iranian public's attention from its murderous crackdown at home against its own people. As this soccer match story indicates, people are growing less afraid to say so in public -- especially after the regime has killed an estimated 750 women, girls and men since a nationwide protest uprising started on Sept. 16, 2022, after the death of a young Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of Iran's morality police. Thousands more have been arrested.
One reason Iran supports the Hamas war and prefers that Israel remain stuck in Gaza and occupying the West Bank is that it keeps the world and many Americans focused on Israeli actions -- rather than on the brutal crackdown against democracy protesters in Iran and on Iran's imperialist influence in the region, where it uses proxies to control the politics of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen and uses those countries as military bases to attack Israel.
No one should think Iran is just a paper tiger. Tehran can still unleash thousands of shorter-range rockets against Israel through Hezbollah -- and because some of these rockets have precision guidance, they could do significant damage to Israel's infrastructure. Iran has bigger missiles in its arsenal, as well.
Still, what happened Saturday is ultimately a significant boost for what I call the Inclusion Network in the Middle East (more open, connected countries like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel and the NATO allies) and a real setback for the Resistance Network (the closed and autocratic systems represented by Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and Iran's Shiite militias in Iraq) and Russia. The sound within Iran and the Resistance Network on Sunday morning is that sound you hear from your car's GPS after a wrong turn: "Recalculating, recalculating, recalculating."

Full text: Experts say Tehran does not want a broader war. But it is far from clear whether Iran or Israel will choose to escalate a conflict that has become more direct and out of the shadows.
Iran has retaliated directly against Israel for the killings of its senior generals in Damascus, Syria, with an onslaught of more than 300 drones and missiles aimed at restoring its credibility and deterrence, officials and analysts say.
That represents a moment of great risk, with key questions still to answer, they say. Has Iran's attack been enough to satisfy its calls for revenge? Or given the relatively paltry results -- almost all of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel and the United States -- will it feel obligated to strike again? And will Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, see the strong performance by his country's air defenses as a sufficient response? Or will he choose to escalate further with an attack on Iran itself?
Now that Iran has attacked Israel as it promised to do, it will want to avoid a broader war, the officials and analysts say, noting that the Iranians targeted only military sites in an apparent effort to avoid civilian casualties and advertised their attack well in advance.
"Iran's government appears to have concluded that the Damascus strike was a strategic inflection point, where failure to retaliate would carry more downsides than benefits," said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. "But in doing so, the shadow war it has been waging with Israel for years now threatens to turn into a very real and very damaging conflict," one that could drag in the United States, he said.
"The Iranians have for now played their card," said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. "They made a choice to call Israel's bluff, and they felt they needed to do so, because they see the last six months as a persistent effort to set them back across the region."
On Sunday, Iranian leaders said the military operation against Israel was over, but warned that they could launch a bigger one depending on Israel's response.
Brig. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's top military officer, said the "operation yielded its complete result" and "there is no intention to continue it." But, he added, if Israel attacked Iran on its own soil, or elsewhere, "our next operation will be much bigger than this."
For years, Iran took blow after blow from Israel: assassinations of its nuclear scientists and military commanders, explosions at its nuclear and military bases, cyberattacks, intelligence infiltrations, an embarrassing theft of nuclear documents and recent attacks on its critical infrastructure.
But since the Hamas-led assault of Oct. 7 prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza, Israel has intensified its attacks on Iranian interests and commanders in Syria. In a series of strikes from December onward, Israel has assassinated at least 18 Iranian commanders and military personnel from the Quds Force, the elite unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that operates outside Iran's borders, Iranian media said.
Iran's government has been criticized by hard-liner supporters for its cautious posture during the war in Gaza.
With the attacks this weekend, Ms. Vakil said: "I think Tehran saw a need to draw this red line and make it clear to Israel that Iran does have red lines and would not continue to tolerate the slow degradation of its position."
Tehran felt it had to respond, even if its attack prompted firm American backing and widespread Western diplomatic support for Israel, taking some of the heat off Israel over its war in Gaza, at least temporarily, and again isolated Iran.
Now, Ms. Vakil said, the two sides were in a standoff in which both were prepared for escalation despite knowing it would cause huge damage to themselves.
At the same time, the old equation has changed, with Israel and Iran hitting each other directly, on each other's territory, and not through Iranian proxies abroad.
The Israeli strike on Iran's Embassy compound in Damascus, followed by a direct Iranian strike on Israel, represents a dangerous new chapter in the long, sometimes hidden war between Israel and Iran, which has said it wants Israel to be wiped off the map. Sometimes known as "the shadow war," the conflict has been carried out mainly between Israel and Iran's allies and proxies -- in Gaza, southern Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Syria.
Both sides claim they are acting in national self-defense -- Israel against groups committed to its destruction, with Iran as their prime ally and controller, and Iran against any potential Israeli war against it, often in the name of the Palestinians.
Iran increasingly refers to its rapidly expanding nuclear program, which has enriched uranium to near weapons-grade, as a deterrent against Israel, while at the same time denying that it has any intention of building a nuclear weapon. But increasingly Iran is considered by experts as a nuclear-threshold state, able to create weapons-grade nuclear material within weeks and a crude nuclear weapon within a year or so.
Iran is also going through a slow and complicated transition as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader and commander in chief, is said to be ailing and faced a 2022 domestic uprising, led by women, that demanded an end to clerical rule.
Mr. Khamenei himself ordered the strikes on Israel from inside Iran to send a clear message that Iran was shifting from "strategic patience" to a more active deterrence, according to four Iranian officials, two of them members of the Revolutionary Guards. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
"Iran's operation has a crystal-clear message to Israel and its allies that the rules of the game have changed and from now on, if Israel strikes any Iranian targets or kills any Iranians, we are willing to strike in a big way and from our own soil," Nasser Imani, a prominent analyst based in Tehran who is close to the government, said in a telephone interview. "The days of covert operations and patience are over."
Iran also wanted to seize what it viewed as a "golden opportunity" to retaliate at this scale, because Israel was being so widely criticized over Gaza, including by its key allies, like the United States, Mr. Imani said.
Iran's reach for regional hegemony, enhanced by its proxies and its nuclear abilities, has antagonized the traditional Sunni Arab governments of the region, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Gulf nations. The Islamic Revolution that overthrew the monarchy in 1979 was at its start aimed at regional revolution, overthrowing these governments, most of which are monarchies or military dictatorships, so Israel's efforts to limit the power of Iran, a non-Arab Shiite nation, have had quiet support from Arab countries, including Israel's war against Hamas.
Now the risks of regional escalation have gone up considerably. Iran has been careful during the war in Gaza to restrain its proxies surrounding Israel against major strikes, and to avoid major Israeli retaliation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in particular. Hezbollah, with its many thousands of rockets aimed at Israel, is considered a major deterrent preventing Israel from directly attacking Iran and especially its nuclear and missile program.
Given Iran's new isolation after this attack, Israel should not respond, said Bruno Tertrais, the deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. "But a threshold has been crossed," he said. And the threshold for "a massive Israeli attack on Iranian territory," he continued, "always an extreme option for Israel whatever the commentators say -- is now lowered."
Mr. Netanyahu, who has been warning of the threat from Iran for two decades and faces severe pressure to respond from within his shaky far-right coalition, may choose to riposte with more force, either at Iran directly or at Hezbollah. But Washington, not having been warned of the Damascus attack, is likely to insist on prior consultation now.
But the modest outcome of the Iranian attacks "may strengthen an Israeli perception that Tehran is on the back foot, lacking the willpower and capacity for deeper engagement, and that now is the moment for Israel to inflict a long sought after deeper blow on Iran and its regional proxies," said Julien Barnes-Dacey, the director of Middle East and North Africa for the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Israel's challenge was always "to thwart the main thrust of the attack while still leaving an opening that will enable the Iranians to say that they achieved their goal," wrote Nahum Barnea, a commentator for Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli daily. The danger is from the two extremes, he continued: "An overly successful Iranian operation is liable to devolve into a regional war; an overly failed Iranian operation will invite another Iranian operation."
Iran's mission to the United Nations suggested in a statement on social media on Saturday that if Israel does not respond, Iran would stand down.
"The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe," the statement said. It also warned that "the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!"

Full text: After several days during which Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei repeatedly vowed that "the evil Zionist regime" would be punished for its April 1 attack on Iran's embassy complex in Damascus that killed seven Iranian military advisers, including three top commanders, the Islamic Republic struck. More than 300 drones and missiles launched from Iranian soil took aim at Israel on Saturday. Nearly all of them were intercepted, mainly by Israeli or American defenses, with a report of just one Israeli casualty, a girl from a Bedouin community wounded by shrapnel.
Will that be the end of it?
It's no secret that Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for decades. The weekend attack is notable for two reasons: its directness and its ineffectuality. Iranian military commanders undoubtedly understood that most of their slow-moving drones, about 170 in all, would be shot down before reaching their targets. They were a diversion. Those commanders were probably more surprised that their 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles also did negligible damage.
That should drive home a clear lesson to Iran's leaders: They are no technological match for the Jewish state, especially when the United States is lending a hand. If Israel decides to respond to the attack with direct strikes on Iran -- perhaps against oil installations, nuclear sites or military infrastructure -- it isn't likely to miss its targets.
As I write this, Israel's cabinet is debating that question. As a matter of self-defense, Israel has every moral and legal right to respond in kind -- and then some. It is not enough for Israel to demonstrate its capacity for defense, as it did over the weekend. It must also re-establish its capacity for deterrence. That is, it needs to show Iran's leaders that the price for bringing their war against Israel out of the shadows will be unbearably high, and is therefore not to be repeated.
But if right is one consideration, prudence is another.
Israel has an unfinished war against Hamas in Gaza, and a direct Israeli attack on Iran could trigger a second full-scale war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, if not with Iran itself. Most Israelis understand that particular war will have to be fought sooner or later -- perhaps before the end of the summer -- and that it will be probably much tougher on them than the Gaza war has been so far.
But war with Hezbollah will demand two things: the full concentration of Israel's fighting capacity and sustained support from the United States.
Iran's attack, and the Biden administration's laudable participation in Israel's defense, is an opportunity for Benjamin Netanyahu to mend frayed ties in Washington and other Western capitals by showing restraint. Among other things, it can help move the House of Representatives finally to vote for the Ukraine-Israel military assistance package that the Senate approved in February. It also buys Israel time to destroy what remains of Hamas's military forces in Gaza.
An Israeli attack now would lack an additional advantage -- the element of surprise. It isn't just Israel's technology that is superior to Iran's. It's also its intelligence, the kind that has been on display with Israeli hits on Iran's top nuclear scientist, senior commanders and the spectacular 2018 heist of its secret nuclear dossiers. The clandestine nature of the warfare has helped to keep Tehran paranoid, vulnerable, and guessing. It's the sort of place where a wise nation wants its enemy to be.
None of this is to say that Israel should simply stand down.
Israel will find opportunities to hit its enemy where it hurts, at a time of its choosing. So, of course, will Iran -- but Iran would do that anyway. Israel's diplomatic facilities have always been vulnerable to Iranian attack, as have civilian Jewish targets. We were reminded of it again on Thursday, when an Argentine court finally held Iran responsible for the 1994 attack on a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people and injured hundreds.
Nor is it to say that Israel doesn't deserve President Biden's full support if it chooses to retaliate for Saturday's attack. The Ayatollah Khamenei surely noted the friction between Israel and the West over Gaza when he ordered the strike; daylight between Israel and the United States is often an invitation to mischief by the common enemies of both. The president has political reasons to avoid another full-scale regional war in an election year. But the best way to avert such a war is to leave Tehran with no illusions that it could separate Israel from the United States by starting one.
The key decisions of the past half-century that have driven the Middle East to the place it is in today have a common origin: Iran's Islamic Revolution of 1979, which brought to power a theocratic despotism intent on sowing fanaticism, brutalizing its own people, destroying Israel and causing misery across the region for the sake of its ideological aims. Saturday's missile attack is the latest example of a long and ugly record. But as Israelis decide how to react, they would serve their interests best by recalling the useful adage that revenge is a dish best served cold.

Netanyahu's Political Hold Is Tested By Iran's Barrage: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: In a deeply polarized country that has again come under attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fate may depend on what happens next.
In a deeply divided Israel, even the dramatic scene above the country's skies on Sunday is open to political interpretation.
For supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's display of defensive technology against an Iranian salvo that included hundreds of drones and missiles proves Mr. Netanyahu has long been right to warn about the threat posed by Iran.
His opponents are loath to give him any credit, reserving their praise for the air force.
"Like everything in Israel in recent years, the story is split into two narratives," said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli political commentator for Al-Monitor, a Middle East news site, and the author of a recent biography of the Israeli leader.
"The division and polarization in Israeli society prevents people from seeing the full picture," Ms. Mualem added.
Iran's barrage on Sunday, launched in response to an Israeli attack on an Iranian Embassy building this month in Damascus that killed several high-ranking commanders in Iran's armed forces, came at a perilous time for Mr. Netanyahu.
At home, he is an unpopular leader whom many hold responsible for his government's policy and intelligence failures that led to the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza. Abroad, he is the focus of international censure over Israel's prosecution of that war, which has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans.
How he ultimately emerges from this episode may depend on what happens next.
Mr. Netanyahu now must make a choice. Will he respond to Iran with a forceful counterattack and potentially entangle Israel and other countries in a broader war? Or will he absorb the attack, which gravely injured one 7-year-old girl but otherwise did limited damage, and defer to the coalition that helped defend Israel in the interests of regional stability?
Israel's allies have been urging restraint.
"The question is whether Israel is going to retaliate immediately, or surprise the Iranians in one way or another," said Efraim Halevy, who served as director of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, during the latter part of Mr. Netanyahu's first term in the 1990s.
No Israeli leader has warned about Iran so consistently as Mr. Netanyahu or, for that matter, has spent so long in office. Israel's longest serving prime minister, he has been in power for about 17 years overall.
Since his first year in office in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu warned that a nuclear Iran would be catastrophic and that time was running out. For the nearly three decades since, he has been sounding the same alarm.
Iran maintains a network of proxy militias across the region, including in Gaza, which the government funds and supplies with weapons. Some of those militias in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon have battled with Israel, creating distractions for the Israeli government and military amid the war with Hamas.
But perhaps more troubling, experts say, is that Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Mr. Netanyahu's backers still credit him with having put Iran's nuclear program on the world agenda then, and they praise him now for investing in the mighty, multilayered air defense system that allowed Israel and its allies, including the United States, to intercept the vast majority of Iranian drones and missiles this weekend before they reached Israel.
Sometimes resorting to gimmicks and antics to draw attention to Iran's nuclear progress, Mr. Netanyahu has in the past made opposing Iran a key part of his global diplomacy. Once, at the United Nations General Assembly he held up a cartoonish drawing of a bomb marked with red lines depicting enrichment levels. Another time, at the Munich Security Conference, he waved around a piece of wreckage from what he said was an Iranian drone sent from Syria and shot down by Israel.
"Everywhere he went he was talking about it," recalled Jeremy Issacharoff, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany and for years the Ministry of Foreign Affairs point man coordinating diplomatic efforts on regional security and the Iranian threat.
At times, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign against Iran has severely strained Israel's relations with American presidents, though bipartisan U.S. support for Israel has long been considered a strategic asset.
Around 2012, Mr. Netanyahu infuriated the Obama administration by pushing hard for President Barack Obama to set clear "red lines" on Iran's nuclear progress that would prompt the United States to undertake a military strike. Before that, the Israeli prime minister was making plans for a unilateral Israeli strike in the face of tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs. It was never clear if Mr. Netanyahu was bluffing, and the prospect of an imminent strike receded.
He further challenged Mr. Obama in 2015 with an impassioned speech to a joint meeting of Congress denouncing what he called a "bad deal" being negotiated by the United States and other world powers with Iran to curb its nuclear program.
When President Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Netanyahu encouraged him to withdraw from the agreement -- a move that many Israeli experts have called a dire mistake and a failure of Mr. Netanyahu's Iran policy.
"Since then, there have been no constraints on the program," Mr. Issacharoff said, adding, "It has never been more advanced."
But it was also under Mr. Netanyahu's watch that Israel forged diplomatic relations with more Arab states that are considered part of the moderate, anti-Iranian axis, including the United Arab Emirates.
Regardless of what comes next, Ms. Mualem, the Netanyahu biographer, said, "Bibi is still in the game," referring to him by his nickname. "He's a central player, and it isn't over, diplomatically or politically. And he plays a long game."

Direct Strikes on Israel Signal a 'New Paradigm' for Iran: [News Analysis]

Full text: Israel had grown used to targeting Iranian officials without head-on retaliation from Iran, an assumption overturned by Iran's attacks on Saturday.
Iran's unprecedented strikes on Israel this weekend have shaken Israel's assumptions about its foe, undermining its long-held calculation that Iran would be best deterred by greater Israeli aggression.
For years, Israeli officials have argued, both in public and in private, that the harder Iran is hit, the warier it will be about fighting back. Iran's barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles on Saturday -- the first direct attack by Iran on Israel -- has overturned that logic.
The attack was a response to Israel's strike earlier this month in Syria that killed seven Iranian military officials there. Analysts said it showed that leaders in Tehran are no longer content with battling Israel through their various proxies, like Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen, but instead are prepared to take on Israel directly.
"I think we miscalculated," said Sima Shine, a former head of research for the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence agency.
"The accumulated experience of Israel is that Iran doesn't have good means to retaliate," Ms. Shine added. "There was a strong feeling that they don't want to be involved in the war."
Instead, Iran has created "a completely new paradigm," Ms. Shine said.
Iran's response ultimately caused little damage in Israel, in large part because Iran had telegraphed its intentions well in advance, giving Israel and its allies several days to prepare a strong defense. Iran also released a statement, even before the attack was over, that it had no further plans to strike Israel.
Nevertheless, Iran's strikes turn a yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran into a direct confrontation -- albeit one that could yet be contained, depending on how Israel responds. Iran has demonstrated that it has considerable firepower that can only be rebuffed with intensive support from Israel's allies, like the United States, underscoring how much damage it could potentially inflict without such protection.
Iran and Israel once had a more ambiguous relationship, with Israel even selling arms to Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. But their ties later frayed after that war ended; Iranian leaders became increasingly critical of Israel's approach to the Palestinians, and Israel grew wary of Iran's efforts to build a nuclear program and its increased support for Hezbollah.
For more than a decade, both countries have quietly targeted each other's interests across the region, while rarely announcing any individual action.
Iran has supported Hamas and financed and armed other regional militias hostile to Israel, several of which have been engaged in a low-level conflict with Israel since the deadly attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7. Similarly, Israel has regularly targeted those proxies, as well as assassinated Iranian officials, including on Iranian soil, killings for which it avoids taking formal responsibility.
Both countries have targeted merchant ships with links to their opponents, as well as carried out cyberattacks on one another, and Israel has repeatedly sabotaged Iran's nuclear program.
Now, that war is out in the open. And in large part, it is because of what some analysts see as an Israeli miscalculation on April 1, when Israeli strikes destroyed part of an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, one of Iran's closest allies and proxies, killing the seven Iranian military officials, including three top commanders.
The attack followed repeated suggestions from Israeli leaders that greater pressure on Iran would encourage Tehran to scale back its ambitions across the Middle East. "An increase in the pressure placed on Iran is critical," Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said in January, "and may prevent regional escalation in additional arenas."
Instead, the Damascus attack led directly to the first Iranian assault on Israeli sovereign territory.
Israel may have misunderstood Iran's position because of the lack of Iranian response to earlier Israeli assassinations of senior Iranian officials, analysts said.
Though Israeli leaders have long feared that Iran will one day build and fire nuclear missiles at Israel, they had grown used to targeting Iranian officials without direct retaliation from Tehran.
In one of the most brazen attacks, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in 2020 on Iranian soil. As recently as December, Israel was accused of killing a top Iranian general, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a strike in Syria, where Iranian military officials advise and support the Syrian government. Those and several other assassinations did not prompt retaliatory Iranian strikes on Israel.
Iran's decision to respond this time was partly prompted by the fury in some circles of Iranian society at Iran's previous passivity, according to Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst.
"The degree of bottom-up pressure that I saw on the regime over the past 10 days, I've never seen before," said Mr. Vaez, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, a research group based in Brussels.
Iran also needed to show proxies like Hezbollah that it could stand up for itself, Mr. Vaez added. "To demonstrate that Iran is too afraid to retaliate against such a brazen attack on its own diplomatic facility in Damascus would have been very damaging for Iran's relations and the credibility of the Iranians in the eyes of their regional partners," he said.
For some analysts, Israel's strike on Damascus may yet prove to have been a smaller miscalculation than it first appeared. Iran's aerial assault has already distracted from Israel's faltering war against Hamas, and reaffirmed Israel's ties with Western and Arab allies who had become increasingly critical of Israel's conduct in Gaza.
The fact that Iran gave Israel so long to prepare for the attack could indicate that Tehran remains relatively deterred, seeking to create only the optics of a major response while trying to avoid a significant escalation, said Michael Koplow, an Israel analyst at the Israel Policy Forum, a research group based in New York.
"To me, the jury is out," Mr. Koplow said.
"The question is whether this was intended to be something that would actually damage Israel, or if this was supposed to be something that made it seem as though they were responding in strength, but actually signaled that they weren't," Mr. Koplow added.
But for others, it was already clear. Aaron David Miller, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based research group, said that Israel had now made two major strategic errors in less than a year: Before Oct. 7, Israeli officials had publicly -- and wrongly -- concluded that Hamas had been deterred from attacking Israel.
Then Hamas launched the deadliest attack in Israel's history.
"When it comes to conceptions, Israel is batting 0 for 2," said Mr. Miller. "They failed to read Hamas's capacity and motivation correctly on Oct. 7 and they clearly misjudged how Iran would respond to the April 1 hit."

President Joe Biden and his team, hoping to avoid further escalation leading to a wider war in the Middle East, are advising Israel that its successful defense against Iranian airstrikes constituted a major strategic victory that might not require another round of retaliation, U.S. officials said Sunday.
The interception of nearly all of the more than 300 drones and missiles fired against Israel on Saturday night demonstrated that Israel had come out ahead in its confrontation with Iran and proved to enemies its ability to protect itself along with its American allies, meaning it did not necessarily need to fire back, officials said.
Whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his government will agree to leave it at that was not yet clear as the country’s war Cabinet met for several hours Sunday to make decisions about its next steps.
The leaders of the Group of 7 major industrial democracies echoed Biden’s message Sunday morning, condemning Iran for the attack and warning that it could provoke what they called an “uncontrollable regional escalation” in the Middle East.
“This must be avoided,” the joint statement said. “We will continue to work to stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation.”
Although damage from the attack was relatively light, the scope of the strikes went well beyond the small-bore tit-for-tat shadow war between Iran and Israel in recent years, crossing a red line with the firing of weapons from Iranian territory into Israeli territory. Had defenses not held, scores or hundreds could have been killed.
American officials said it was clear to them that wide-scale death was Iran’s intent, despite the fact that its leadership telegraphed the attack well in advance, publicly and privately. Officials said that even as the attack was underway, Iran’s government sent word through Swiss intermediaries that it considered the matter closed.
“I mean, look at the size and the scale, the scope of what they fired into Israel from Iran proper: more than 300 missiles and drones,” John F. Kirby, the national security spokesperson at the White House, said Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “They wanted to cause damage — no question about that. But they were utterly unsuccessful in doing so.”
Emotions were running high among Israeli officials during phone calls with American partners late into the night, and the pressure to fire back was consequently strong. The U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions, stressed that the decision about whether and how to respond was ultimately up to Israel.
Israeli jets early Sunday hit structures in Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah after the Iranian-backed militia sent two explosive drones into Israel, but it was not clear how related that was to the Iranian airstrike.
Biden spoke with Netanyahu on Saturday after the Iranian attack and repeated his “ironclad commitment” to Israel’s security. Biden urged restraint, telling Netanyahu that it was time to “think carefully and strategically” about the risks of escalation if the Israelis respond in kind with military force, according to one senior administration official.
In a statement released after the call, Biden hinted publicly at a desire for actions that would not continue a cycle of retribution.
“I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks — sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel,” Biden said.
“Taken together, @JoeBiden’s message is designed to gently persuade #Israel not to pursue further escalation,” Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, wrote on social media.
That is likely to generate criticism of Biden from conservatives, some of whom quickly went public urging a powerful military reprisal against Iran — not only by Israel, but by the United States, as well. “We must move quickly and launch aggressive retaliatory strikes on Iran,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a statement posted online.
House Speaker Mike Johnson partly blamed the Biden administration for the Iran strike because of what he called its “undermining of Israel and appeasement of Iran.” He did not mention that he has so far failed to permit a floor vote on bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate providing security aid to Israel and Ukraine. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican leader, said that “in light of Iran’s unjustified attack on Israel,” the House this week would consider aid to Israel, but he gave no details. Johnson also said Sunday that the House would take up Israel aid in the coming days.
The eruption between Israel and Iran came at a time of great tension between Biden and Netanyahu. In a call only 10 days ago, the president threatened to rethink his support for Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip if Netanyahu did not do more to alleviate civilian suffering in the enclave, leveraging American backing for the first time since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.
At the same time the two leaders clashed, Israel had just executed an airstrike against the Iranian Embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, killing seven Iranian officers involved in covert operations in a move that threatened the escalation that Biden had long feared. Even so, the president made clear that his support for Israel’s security was still unwavering and warned Iran not to respond.
American and Israeli officials spent the past few days coordinating military operations in case Iran did act, and Biden ordered aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region. Even as the attack began, Michael Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, and the Israeli defense attache were meeting with officials at the White House to coordinate the response to the attack.
Administration officials were elated at the results as U.S. and Israeli forces knocked down nearly everything thrown at Israel, including more than 100 ballistic missiles, a feat that one official said might be unmatched in military history. Jordan intercepted projectiles crossing its airspace, saying it was guarding its own security.
American officials said U.S. fighter jets shot down more than 70 exploding drones in the attack, while two Navy warships in the eastern Mediterranean destroyed four to six ballistic missiles, and an Army Patriot battery in Iraq knocked down at least one missile that passed overhead. The number of drones and missiles that Iran launched — more than 300 — was on the high end of what U.S. analysts had expected, one official said.
On Sunday morning, Biden spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan about the attack and called two members of the 494th and 335th fighter squadrons to praise them for the successful mission.
Even though Iran did little tangible damage, it signaled after the strikes that it was ready to stand down — and clearly hoped to avoid direct engagement with the United States. “The matter can be deemed concluded,” the Iranian mission to the United Nations said in a statement. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”
The situation was reminiscent of January 2020, when President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike in Iraq to kill Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who led the powerful Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at well-defended U.S. bases in Iraq with relatively little damage, though about 100 U.S. military personnel were wounded. It then sent a private message saying it was done. Trump chose not to retaliate, and fears of a cycle of escalation faded.
In the days leading up to attack Saturday, Netanyahu warned Tehran not to act, saying, “Whoever hurts us, we hurt them.” But because Israel was not badly hurt, Netanyahu may have some room to declare victory and move on. Israeli officials were not clear on their intentions.
“The campaign is not over yet — we must remain alert and attentive to the instructions published by the IDF and Homefront Command,” said Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, referring to the Israeli military. “We must be prepared for every scenario. Having said this, we have thwarted the most significant wave” of the attack, “and we did so successfully.”
The American argument was that because Israel also successfully took out those senior Iranian officers in Damascus two weeks ago without paying a significant price, another round of military action could be deemed unnecessary.

Iran’s Strikes on Israel Open a Dangerous New Chapter for Old Rivals

BERLIN — Iran has retaliated directly against Israel for the killings of its senior generals in Damascus, Syria, with an onslaught of more than 300 drones and missiles aimed at restoring its credibility and deterrence, officials and analysts say.
That represents a moment of great risk, with key questions still to answer, they say. Has Iran’s attack been enough to satisfy its calls for revenge? Or given the relatively paltry results — almost all of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel and the United States — will it feel obligated to strike again? And will Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, see the strong performance by his country’s air defenses as a sufficient response? Or will he choose to escalate further with an attack on Iran itself?
Now that Iran has attacked Israel as it promised to do, it will want to avoid a broader war, the officials and analysts say, noting that the Iranians targeted only military sites in an apparent effort to avoid civilian casualties and advertised their attack well in advance.
“Iran’s government appears to have concluded that the Damascus strike was a strategic inflection point, where failure to retaliate would carry more downsides than benefits,” said Ali Vaez, Iran director of the International Crisis Group. “But in doing so, the shadow war it has been waging with Israel for years now threatens to turn into a very real and very damaging conflict,” one that could drag in the United States, he said.
“The Iranians have for now played their card,” said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. “They made a choice to call Israel’s bluff, and they felt they needed to do so, because they see the last six months as a persistent effort to set them back across the region.”
On Sunday, Iranian leaders said the military operation against Israel was over but warned that they could launch a bigger one depending on Israel’s response.
Brig. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s top military officer, said the “operation yielded its complete result” and “there is no intention to continue it.” But, he added, if Israel attacked Iran on its own soil or elsewhere, “our next operation will be much bigger than this.”
For years, Iran took blow after blow from Israel: assassinations of its nuclear scientists and military commanders, explosions at its nuclear and military bases, cyberattacks, intelligence infiltrations, an embarrassing theft of nuclear documents and recent attacks on its critical infrastructure.
But since the Hamas-led assault of Oct. 7 prompted Israel to go to war in the Gaza Strip, Israel has intensified its attacks on Iranian interests and commanders in Syria. In a series of strikes from December onward, Israel has assassinated at least 18 Iranian commanders and military personnel from the Quds Force, the elite unit of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard that operates outside Iran’s borders, Iranian media said.
Iran’s government has been criticized by hard-liner supporters for its cautious posture during the war in Gaza.
With the attacks this weekend, Vakil said: “I think Tehran saw a need to draw this red line and make it clear to Israel that Iran does have red lines and would not continue to tolerate the slow degradation of its position.”
Tehran felt it had to respond, even if its attack prompted firm American backing and widespread Western diplomatic support for Israel, taking some of the heat off Israel over its war in Gaza, at least temporarily, and again isolated Iran.
Now, Vakil said, the two sides were in a standoff in which both were prepared for escalation despite knowing it would cause huge damage to themselves.
At the same time, the old equation has changed, with Israel and Iran hitting each other directly, on each other’s territory, and not through Iranian proxies abroad.
The Israeli strike on Iran’s Embassy compound in Damascus, followed by a direct Iranian strike on Israel, represents a dangerous new chapter in the long, sometimes hidden war between Israel and Iran, which has said it wants Israel to be wiped off the map. Sometimes known as “the shadow war,” the conflict has been carried out mainly between Israel and Iran’s allies and proxies — in Gaza, southern Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Syria.
Both sides claim they are acting in national self-defense — Israel against groups committed to its destruction, with Iran as their prime ally and controller, and Iran against any potential Israeli war against it, often in the name of the Palestinians.
Iran increasingly refers to its rapidly expanding nuclear program, which has enriched uranium to near weapons-grade, as a deterrent against Israel, while at the same time denying that it has any intention of building a nuclear weapon. But increasingly Iran is considered by experts as a nuclear-threshold state, able to create weapons-grade nuclear material within weeks and a crude nuclear weapon within a year or so.
Iran is also going through a slow and complicated transition as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader and commander in chief, is said to be ailing and faced a 2022 domestic uprising, led by women, that demanded an end to clerical rule.
Khamenei himself ordered the strikes on Israel from inside Iran to send a clear message that Iran was shifting from “strategic patience” to a more active deterrence, according to four Iranian officials, two of them members of the Revolutionary Guard. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
“Iran’s operation has a crystal-clear message to Israel and its allies that the rules of the game have changed, and from now on, if Israel strikes any Iranian targets or kills any Iranians, we are willing to strike in a big way and from our own soil,” Nasser Imani, a prominent analyst based in Tehran who is close to the government, said in a telephone interview. “The days of covert operations and patience are over.”
Iran also wanted to seize what it viewed as a “golden opportunity” to retaliate at this scale, because Israel was being so widely criticized over Gaza, including by its key allies, like the United States, Imani said.
Iran’s reach for regional hegemony, enhanced by its proxies and its nuclear abilities, has antagonized the traditional Sunni Arab governments of the region, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Gulf nations. The Islamic Revolution that overthrew the monarchy in 1979 was at its start aimed at regional revolution, overthrowing these governments, most of which are monarchies or military dictatorships, so Israel’s efforts to limit the power of Iran, a non-Arab Shiite nation, have had quiet support from Arab countries, including Israel’s war against Hamas.
Now the risks of regional escalation have gone up considerably. Iran has been careful during the war in Gaza to restrain its proxies surrounding Israel against major strikes and to avoid major Israeli retaliation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in particular. Hezbollah, with its many thousands of rockets aimed at Israel, is considered a major deterrent preventing Israel from directly attacking Iran and especially its nuclear and missile program.
Given Iran’s new isolation after this attack, Israel should not respond, said Bruno Tertrais, deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. “But a threshold has been crossed,” he said. And the threshold for “a massive Israeli attack on Iranian territory,” he continued, “always an extreme option for Israel whatever the commentators say — is now lowered.”
Netanyahu, who has been warning of the threat from Iran for two decades and faces severe pressure to respond from within his shaky far-right coalition, may choose to riposte with more force, either at Iran directly or at Hezbollah. But the U.S., not having been warned of the Damascus attack, is likely to insist on prior consultation now.
But the modest outcome of the Iranian attacks “may strengthen an Israeli perception that Tehran is on the back foot, lacking the willpower and capacity for deeper engagement, and that now is the moment for Israel to inflict a long-sought-after, deeper blow on Iran and its regional proxies,” said Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of Middle East and North Africa for the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Israel’s challenge was always “to thwart the main thrust of the attack while still leaving an opening that will enable the Iranians to say that they achieved their goal,” wrote Nahum Barnea, a commentator for Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli daily. The danger is from the two extremes, he continued: “An overly successful Iranian operation is liable to devolve into a regional war; an overly failed Iranian operation will invite another Iranian operation.”
Iran’s mission to the United Nations suggested in a statement on social media Saturday that if Israel does not respond, Iran would stand down.
“The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” the statement said. It also warned that “the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”

Full text: Iran launched more than 200 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles toward Israel on Saturday evening, the Israeli military said, in retaliation for a deadly Israeli airstrike on the Iranian Embassy complex in the Syrian capital this month.
The attack, which is believed to be the first direct Iranian assault inside Israel, threatened to open a volatile chapter in the long-running shadow war between the two nations.
The Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said at a news briefing that the strikes had caused minor damage to an Israeli military base. The vast majority of Iran's arsenal, he added, had been intercepted by Israel with "some assistance" from its allies.
"Only one little girl has been hurt," he said, without giving further details.
But Admiral Hagari called Iran's strikes "a severe and dangerous escalation." He added, "Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest level of readiness ahead of this large-scale attack from Iran."
Air-raid sirens sounded across Israel, loud booms were heard across Jerusalem and in the Golan Heights, and a video showed what appear to be Israeli air-defense interceptors in the sky above the Old City of Jerusalem.
President Biden cut short a weekend trip to his vacation home in Delaware and returned to the White House to huddle with his national security team over the situation. A Defense Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, said U.S. forces were helping to shoot down Iranian drones, without providing more details.
"In accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's security, U.S. forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian-launched drones targeting Israel," the Defense Department official said.
Britain's defense secretary, Grant Shapps, said in a statement that additional British jets and air refueling tankers had been deployed to bolster the country's existing operations in Iraq and Syria, and its jets would "intercept" airborne attacks within range of its missions there.
Before the drones and missiles arrived, two Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military intelligence said the targets were likely to be the Golan Heights and an Israeli air force base in the Negev Desert.
Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon, announced that it had also fired dozens of rockets at Israeli barracks in the Golan Heights, a plateau on Israel's northeast border with Syria and Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War in 1967.
Hezbollah and Israel have been firing at each other ever since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by another Iranian proxy group, Hamas, that led to the war in Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel met with his war cabinet, according to his office. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Israel's minister of defense, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday and made clear that Israel could count on full U.S. support to defend itself, said the Pentagon's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is responsible for securing Iran's borders, said in a statement that it had launched "dozens" of drones and missiles toward Israel "in reaction to the Zionist regime's crimes." The Guards said in a later statement that they had hit military targets in Israel, warned the United States against getting involved and threatened more strikes if Iran or its interests were hit.
"We warn the United States terrorist government that any support or participation in attacking Iran's interests will have a fierce response from Iran's Armed Forces," the statement said, warning Iran's neighbors that if Iran were attacked from their territory, Iran would respond.
The strikes on Saturday came after a week of diplomacy and uncertainty about how far Iran would go in response to the Israeli attack in Damascus, the Syrian capital, on April 1 and whether it would risk starting an outright war with Israel. Senior Iranian officials and military commanders had vowed to retaliate after the airstrike in Damascus, which killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers.
"We will make them regret this crime and similar crimes, with the help of God," Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared after the strike.
The United States, Israel and Iran all placed their militaries on high alert after the Damascus attack. The head of U.S. Central Command also traveled to Israel in anticipation of an Iranian strike. The question was not so much whether Iran would retaliate, but how and when.
Iran's mission to the United Nations said on social media that the attack on Israel was in line with the U.N. charter of legitimate self-defense and suggested that the standoff with Israel could end if it did not attack in response.
"The matter can be deemed concluded," the mission said. "However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe."
The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, strongly condemned Iran's attacks and urged all parties "to exercise maximum restraint" to avoid further military escalation in the Middle East. "I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war," he said in a statement.
The U.N. Security Council said it would hold an emergency meeting on Sunday afternoon to discuss Iran's attacks on Israel, said Malta's U.N. mission, which holds the rotating presidency to the U.N. Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, had requested the Council session.
Iran's attack came on the same day that its forces seized a container ship with links to Israel in the Persian Gulf. Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, called on Iran to release the vessel and its crew immediately, calling it "a blatant violation of international law."
In anticipation of Iran's counterattack, neighboring Jordan and Lebanon temporarily closed their airspace, as did Israel.
The Israeli military said all schools would be closed across the country and gatherings of more than 1,000 people limited from 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 p.m. on Monday. The Israeli authorities also ordered residents of the Golan Heights, some areas of the Negev, and Eilat to remain close to protected shelters.
Zaki Heller, a spokesman for Magen David Adom, an Israeli emergency response service, said by phone that medics treated a 10-year-old girl who was believed to have been wounded in the head by shrapnel in the Negev Desert and was in serious condition. About 20 other people were treated for anxiety or injuries suffered while seeking shelter, the group added.
France on Saturday condemned "in the strongest possible terms" the Iranian strike on Israel. "By taking such an unprecedented action, Iran has crossed a new threshold in its destabilizing actions, and runs the risk of military escalation," Stéphane Séjourné, France's foreign minister, said on X.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada also said in a statement: "We stand with Israel. After supporting Hamas' brutal October 7 attack, the Iranian regime's latest actions will further destabilize the region and make lasting peace more difficult."
Tehran was split over how to respond after the Israeli strike in Damascus, a significant move between the two adversaries. Divisions over possible retaliation arose at an emergency meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, three Iranians familiar with the deliberations said.
Arguing that anything short of a direct response would be taken for weakness, some hard-line members said Iran should strike targets in Israel. Other Iranian officials called for continuing the policy of "strategic patience" and to retaliate through its proxy militias in the Middle East, the three Iranians said.
The Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday that the attack on Israel had been ordered by Iran's Supreme National Security Council, under the guidance of the senior military body that coordinates Iran's armed forces.
The Israeli airstrike on April 1 targeted high-ranking members of the Revolutionary Guards unit that oversees covert operations in the Mideast, the Quds Force. Among those killed was the top commander for the region, Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi.
The death of General Zahedi was described as particularly stunning to Iranian leaders. Their outrage was not just over the blow to their military leadership, but also over the decision by the Israelis to strike the embassy complex.
Diplomatic buildings are generally viewed as off-limits. But Israeli officials denied that the building had diplomatic status and the protections that would go with it.
Amid the attack on Saturday, Iranians flocked to gas stations in the middle of the night, forming miles-long lines in Tehran and other big cities, videos posted on social media showed. The Ministry of Petroleum reassured the public that there was no shortage of gasoline and no need to fill up tanks.
On social media, supporters of Iran's government cheered the attacks as a "fierce slap" against Israel. "If the Zionist regime strikes Iran in the future, it will be severely punished," Seyed Mohammad Marandi, an adviser to Iran's nuclear negotiating team and Foreign Ministry, said in a post on X.
On Saturday, Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that works on preventing and resolving deadly conflict, said in an interview that "Iran and Israel are taking the region into uncharted waters."
He added, "It is difficult to overstate how perilous this moment is, and how disastrous its consequences could prove."

JERUSALEM — Iran launched more than 200 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles toward Israel on Saturday evening, the Israeli military said, in retaliation for a deadly Israeli airstrike on the Iranian Embassy complex in the Syrian capital this month.
The attack, which is believed to be the first direct Iranian assault inside Israel, threatened to open a volatile chapter in the long-running shadow war between the two nations.
The Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said at a news briefing that the strikes had caused minor damage to an Israeli military base. The vast majority of Iran’s arsenal, he added, had been intercepted by Israel with “some assistance” from its allies.
“Only one little girl has been hurt,” he said, without giving further details.
But Hagari called Iran’s strikes “a severe and dangerous escalation.” He added, “Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest level of readiness ahead of this large-scale attack from Iran.”
Air-raid sirens sounded across Israel, loud booms were heard across Jerusalem and in the Golan Heights, and a video showed what appear to be Israeli air-defense interceptors in the sky above the Old City of Jerusalem.
President Joe Biden cut short a weekend trip to his vacation home in Delaware and returned to the White House to huddle with his national security team over the situation. A Defense Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, said U.S. forces were helping to shoot down Iranian drones, without providing more details.
“In accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, U.S. forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian-launched drones targeting Israel,” the Defense Department official said.
Britain’s defense secretary, Grant Shapps, said in a statement that additional British jets and air refueling tankers had been deployed to bolster the country’s existing operations in Iraq and Syria, and its jets would “intercept” airborne attacks within range of its missions there.
Before the drones and missiles arrived, two Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military intelligence said the targets were likely to be the Golan Heights and an Israeli air force base in the Negev Desert.

Hezbollah and Israel have been firing at each other ever since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by another Iranian proxy group, Hamas, that led to the war in the Gaza Strip.

Full text: In anticipation of the Iranian strikes, several countries, including the United States, issued new guidelines to their citizens about travel in Israel and the surrounding region.
American intelligence analysts and officials said on Friday that they expected Iran to strike multiple targets inside Israel within the next few days in retaliation for an Israeli bombing in the Syrian capital on April 1 that killed several senior Iranian commanders.
The United States, Israel's pre-eminent ally, has military forces in several places across the Middle East. But Iran is not expected to target them in order to avoid a direct conflict with the United States, according to U.S. and Iranian officials who spoke anonymously about the expected attacks, which they were not authorized to discuss publicly.
Any Iranian strike inside Israel would be a watershed moment in the decades of hostilities between the two nations that would most likely open a volatile new chapter in the region. Israel and Iran do not maintain any direct channels of communication, making the chances far greater that each side could misread the other's intentions. And an Iranian attack would heighten the risk of a wider conflict that could drag in multiple countries, including the United States.
In remarks to reporters on Friday, President Biden said that he expected a military attack against Israel "sooner than later," and that his message to Iran was "don't."
"We are devoted to the defense of Israel," he added. "We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed."
In anticipation of an Iranian strike, several countries, including the United States, have issued new guidelines to their citizens for travel in Israel and the surrounding region. The Israeli military said its forces were on high alert.
The U.S. State Department barred its employees on Thursday from traveling to large parts of Israel, the first time the U.S. government has restricted its employees' movement this way since the war in Gaza began more than six months ago.
On Thursday, Britain told its citizens that they "should consider leaving" Israel and the Palestinian territories "if it is safe to do so." On Friday, India told its citizens "not to travel to Iran or Israel till further notice." And France advised people not to travel to Israel, Iran or Lebanon, and evacuated the families of French diplomats from Iran.
Details about Iran's potential attack on Israel are closely guarded, but American and Israeli officials have assessed that it might involve drones and missiles. Iran has the largest arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones in the Middle East, including cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, experts say, as well as short-range and long-range ballistic missiles with ranges up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles).
Iran also has a large inventory of drones that have a range of about 1,200 to 1,550 miles and are capable of flying low to evade radar.
The exact form an attack on Israel might take, what kinds of targets would be involved and the precise timing all remain unclear.
The top American military commander for the Middle East, Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, traveled to Israel this week to coordinate a response should Iran attack, U.S. officials said.
"Our enemies think that they will divide Israel and the United States," the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said in a statement on Friday, after meeting with General Kurilla. "They are connecting us and are strengthening the relationship between us."
If Iran attacks, he added, "we will know how to respond."
On Thursday, the Israeli military's chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the armed forces were "highly alert and prepared" for any action from Iran.
Iran has publicly and repeatedly vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike on its embassy complex in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed three generals and four officers from its elite Quds Force, an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
But analysts say Iranian leaders want to calibrate their response so that it is big enough to send a message at home and abroad that Iran is not impotent in the face of conflict, but not so big that it spirals into a full-fledged war with Israel or draws an American attack.
In the first months of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Iran-backed militias regularly attacked U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and Jordan. But after a drone strike killed three Americans in Jordan in January and the United States launched retaliatory strikes, Iran stopped the attacks by its proxies, fearing a more powerful U.S. response.
Despite the clashes and hostile rhetoric, both Iranian and U.S. leaders have made it clear they want to avoid an all-out war.
John F. Kirby, the White House's national security spokesman, told reporters on Friday, "We are certainly mindful of a very public and what we consider to be a very credible threat made by Iran in terms of potential attacks on Israel, and that we are in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts about making sure that they can defend themselves against those kinds of attacks."
How Israel would respond to an Iranian attack on its soil is unclear. The Israeli military "continues to monitor closely what is happening in Iran and different arenas," Herzi Halevi, chief of the Israeli general staff, said in a statement on Friday. He added, "Our forces are prepared and ready at all times and for any scenario."
Iran believes it can generate international support for a retaliatory strike by focusing attention on the attack against its embassy complex and arguing that it was merely defending itself, the Iranian officials said.
International law generally treats embassies and consulates as exempt from attacks. But Israeli officials have argued that the building they destroyed was diplomatic in name only, and was being used as a Revolutionary Guards base, as evidenced by the high-level commanders who were meeting there when they were killed.
A strategist for the Revolutionary Guards said Iran wanted to take advantage of the widening rift between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Mr. Biden over Israel's conduct of the war against Hamas -- and not unite them in hostility to Iran.
The Biden administration has not only criticized the level of death and destruction wrought by Israeli forces in Gaza, it has also voiced fears that increased clashes across Israel's northern borders, primarily with Iranian proxies like Hezbollah, could escalate into a broader regional war.
In an apparent response to international pressure, including from the United States, to do more to alleviate the hunger and deprivation produced by the war in Gaza, the Israeli military said on Friday that it had begun allowing humanitarian aid trucks to enter northern Gaza through a new crossing.
The military did not specify the location of the new crossing, and it remained unclear how many trucks had crossed, what aid agency they belonged to and when the crossing might be open for wider use.
Jamie McGoldrick, a top U.N. relief official in Jerusalem, said that U.N. officials planned to head to the crossing on Saturday to examine it. He said the crossing would be a significant improvement "if it can go to scale and is not temporary."
After Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers on April 1, Mr. Biden told Mr. Netanyahu by phone that the United States could withhold military support for Israel unless it did more to protect civilians and ensure adequate supplies for Palestinian civilians.
Mr. Gallant, Israel's defense minister, pledged on Wednesday to "flood Gaza with aid" and said he expected to ultimately see 500 relief trucks entering the enclave on a daily basis. U.N. figures show that an average of about 110 aid trucks have entered Gaza daily since the war began on Oct. 7.
Mr. Gallant also said that Israel would soon open the port of Ashdod, an Israeli city north of Gaza, to accept aid shipments, without providing a time frame.

Full text: The possibility of a direct military confrontation between Iran and Israel has brought renewed attention to Iran's armed forces. What are they capable of?
The possibility of a direct military confrontation between Iran and Israel has brought renewed attention to Iran's armed forces. Early this month, Israel attacked a building in Iran's diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital, Damascus, killing seven of Iran's senior commanders and military personnel. Iran then threatened to retaliate.
Here's a look at Iran's military and its capabilities.
Why is Iran's military relevant right now?
After Israel attacked the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, Tehran responded with a threat to avenge the killings of its military personnel. Israel has said the compound was a legitimate target because it was being used by military commanders.
Officials from the United States and Israel assessed that Iran's response was likely to be launched from its own territory.
That was what the Iranians did after President Donald J. Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in 2020, firing ballistic missiles at two American military bases in Iraq and wounding over 100 American soldiers.
Israeli officials have said they will respond to any attack by Iran with a counterattack, which could prompt more retaliation from Iran and possibly expand into a wider regional war. There is even a chance that a conflict of that sort could drag in the United States, although Washington has made clear it had nothing to do with the Damascus attack.
While Iran is expected to mount an attack within days on Israel, U.S. and Iranian officials said Friday that they did not expect the United States or its military forces to be targeted.
In any case, President Biden has pledged "ironclad" support for Israel in the event of an Iranian assault.
Analysts say that Iran's adversaries, primarily the United States and Israel, have avoided direct military strikes on Iran for decades, not wishing to tangle with Tehran's complex military apparatus. Instead, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a long shadow war via air, sea, land and cyberattacks, and Israel has covertly targeted military and nuclear facilities inside Iran and killed commanders and scientists.
"There is a reason Iran has not been struck," said Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School and an expert on Iran's military. "It's not that Iran's adversaries fear Iran. It's that they realize any war against Iran is a very serious war."
What sort of military threat does Iran pose?
The Iranian armed forces are among the largest in the Middle East, with at least 580,000 active-duty personnel and about 200,000 trained reserve personnel divided among the traditional army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, according to an annual assessment last year by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
The army and the Guards each have separate and active ground, air and naval forces, with the Guards responsible for Iran's border security. The General Staff of the Armed Forces coordinates the branches and sets the overall strategy.
The Guards also operate the Quds Force, an elite unit in charge of arming, training and supporting the network of proxy militias throughout the Middle East known as the "axis of resistance." These militias include Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, militia groups in Syria and Iraq and Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza.
The commander in chief of Iran's armed forces is the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on all major decisions.
While the proxy militias are not counted as part of Iran's armed forces, analysts say they are considered an allied regional force -- battle ready, heavily armed and ideologically loyal -- and could come to Iran's aid if it was attacked.
"The level of support and types of systems Iran has provided for nonstate actors is really unprecedented in terms of drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles," said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Iran's military at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Berlin. "They could be viewed as part of Iran's military capability, especially Hezbollah, which has the closest strategic relationship with Iran."
What kinds of weapons does Iran have?
For decades, Iran's military strategy has been anchored in deterrence, emphasizing the development of precision and long-range missiles, drones and air defenses. It has built a large fleet of speedboats and some small submarines that are capable of disrupting shipping traffic and global energy supplies that pass through the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.
Iran has one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles and drones in the Middle East, Mr. Ostovar said. That includes cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as ballistic missiles with ranges up to 2,000 kilometers, or more than 1,200 miles. These have the capacity and range to hit any target in the Middle East, including Israel.
In recent years, Tehran has assembled a large inventory of drones with ranges of around 1,200 to 1,550 miles and capable of flying low to evade radar, according to experts and Iranian commanders who have given public interviews to the state news media. Iran has made no secret of the buildup, displaying its trove of drones and missiles during military parades, and has ambitions to build a large export business in drones. Iran's drones are being used by Russia in Ukraine and have surfaced in the conflict in Sudan.
The country's bases and storage facilities are widely dispersed, buried deep underground and fortified with air defenses, making them difficult to destroy with airstrikes, experts say.
Where does Iran get its weapons?
International sanctions have cut Iran off from high-tech weaponry and military equipment manufactured abroad, like tanks and fighter jets.
During Iran's eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, few countries were willing to sell weapons to Iran. When Ayatollah Khamenei became Iran's supreme leader in 1989, a year after the war ended, he commissioned the Guards to develop a domestic weapons industry and poured resources into the effort, which was widely reported in the Iranian news media. He wanted to assure that Iran would never again have to rely on foreign powers for its defense needs.
Today, Iran manufactures a large quantity of missiles and drones domestically and has prioritized that defense production, experts said. Its attempts to make armored vehicles and large naval vessels have met with mixed results. It also imports small submarines from North Korea while expanding and modernizing its domestically produced fleet.
How do other countries see Iran's military, and what are its weaknesses?
Iran's military is viewed as one of the strongest in the region in terms of equipment, cohesion, experience and quality of personnel, but it lags far behind the power and sophistication of the armed forces of the United States, Israel and some European countries, experts said.
Iran's greatest weakness is its air force. Much of the country's aircraft date from the era of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who led Iran from 1941 to 1979, and many have been disabled for lack of spare parts. The country also bought a small fleet from Russia in the 1990s, experts said.
Iran's tanks and armored vehicles are old, and the country has only a few large naval vessels, experts said. Two intelligence gathering vessels, the Saviz and Behshad, deployed on the Red Sea, have aided the Houthis in identifying Israeli-owned ships for attacks, American officials have said.
Will Israel's attack disrupt Iran's military?
The assassinations are expected to have a short-term impact on Iran's regional operations, having eliminated commanders with years of experience and relationships with the heads of the allied militias. Nevertheless, the chain of command for the armed forces inside Iran remains intact, experts say, and those leaders would be the ones directing strikes on Israel or other targets and defending Iranian territory if war were to break out.

U.S. intelligence analysts and officials said Friday that they expected Iran to strike multiple targets inside Israel within the next few days in retaliation for an Israeli bombing April 1 in the Syrian capital that killed several senior Iranian commanders.
The United States, Israel’s preeminent ally, has military forces in several places across the Middle East. But Iran is not expected to target them in order to avoid a direct conflict with the United States, according to U.S. and Iranian officials who spoke anonymously about the expected attacks, which they were not authorized to discuss publicly.
Any Iranian strike inside Israel would be a watershed moment in the decades of hostilities between the two nations that would most likely open a volatile new chapter in the region. Israel and Iran do not maintain any direct channels of communication, making the chances far greater that each side could misread the other’s intentions. And an Iranian attack would heighten the risk of a wider conflict that could drag in multiple countries, including the United States.
In remarks to reporters Friday, President Joe Biden said that he expected a military attack against Israel “sooner than later” and that his message to Iran was “don’t.”
“We are devoted to the defense of Israel,” he added. “We will support Israel. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed.”
In anticipation of an Iranian strike, several countries, including the United States, issued new guidelines to their citizens for travel in Israel and the surrounding region. The Israeli military said its forces were on high alert.
The State Department barred its employees Thursday from traveling to large parts of Israel, the first time the U.S. government has restricted its employees’ movement this way since the war in the Gaza Strip began more than six months ago.
On Thursday, Britain told its citizens that they “should consider leaving” Israel and the Palestinian territories “if it is safe to do so.” On Friday, India told its citizens “not to travel to Iran or Israel till further notice.” And France advised people not to travel to Israel, Iran or Lebanon, and evacuated the families of French diplomats from Iran.
Details about Iran’s potential attack on Israel are closely guarded, but U.S. and Israeli officials have assessed that it might involve drones and missiles. Iran has the largest arsenal of ballistic missiles and drones in the Middle East, including cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, experts say, as well as short-range and long-range ballistic missiles with ranges up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles).
Iran also has a large inventory of drones that have a range of about 1,200 to 1,550 miles and are capable of flying low to evade radar.
The exact form an attack on Israel might take, what kinds of targets would be involved and the precise timing all remain unclear.
The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Gen. Erik Kurilla, traveled to Israel this week to coordinate a response should Iran attack, U.S. officials said.
“Our enemies think that they will divide Israel and the United States,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a statement Friday after meeting with Kurilla. “They are connecting us and are strengthening the relationship between us.”
If Iran attacks, he added, “we will know how to respond.”
On Thursday, the Israeli military’s chief spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the armed forces were “highly alert and prepared” for any action from Iran.
Iran has publicly and repeatedly vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike on its embassy complex in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed three generals and four officers from its elite Quds Force, an arm of the Revolutionary Guard.
But analysts say Iranian leaders want to calibrate their response so that it is big enough to send a message at home and abroad that Iran is not impotent in the face of conflict, but not so big that it spirals into a full-fledged war with Israel or draws an American attack.
In the first months of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Iran-backed militias regularly attacked U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and Jordan. But after a drone strike killed three Americans in Jordan in January and the United States launched retaliatory strikes, Iran stopped the attacks by its proxies, fearing a more powerful U.S. response.
Despite the clashes and hostile rhetoric, both Iranian and U.S. leaders have made it clear that they want to avoid an all-out war.
John Kirby, the White House’s national security spokesperson, told reporters Friday, “We are certainly mindful of a very public and what we consider to be a very credible threat made by Iran in terms of potential attacks on Israel, and that we are in constant communication with our Israeli counterparts about making sure that they can defend themselves against those kinds of attacks.”
How Israel would respond to an Iranian attack on its soil is unclear. The Israeli military “continues to monitor closely what is happening in Iran and different arenas,” Herzi Halevi, chief of the Israeli general staff, said in a statement Friday. He added, “Our forces are prepared and ready at all times and for any scenario.”
Iran believes it can generate international support for a retaliatory strike by focusing attention on the attack against its embassy complex and arguing that it was merely defending itself, the Iranian officials said.
International law generally treats embassies and consulates as exempt from attacks. But Israeli officials have argued that the building they destroyed was diplomatic in name only and was being used as a Revolutionary Guard base, as evidenced by the high-level commanders who were meeting there when they were killed.
A strategist for the Revolutionary Guard said Iran wanted to take advantage of the widening rift between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Biden over Israel’s conduct of the war against Hamas — and not unite them in hostility to Iran.
The Biden administration has not only criticized the level of death and destruction wrought by Israeli forces in Gaza, it has voiced fears that increased clashes across Israel’s northern borders, primarily with Iranian proxies like Hezbollah, could escalate into a broader regional war.
In an apparent response to international pressure, including from the United States, to do more to alleviate the hunger and deprivation produced by the war in Gaza, the Israeli military said Friday that it had begun allowing humanitarian aid trucks to enter northern Gaza through a new crossing.
The military did not specify the location of the new crossing, and it remained unclear how many trucks had crossed, what aid agency they belonged to and when the crossing might be open for wider use.
Jamie McGoldrick, a top U.N. relief official in Jerusalem, said that U.N. officials planned to head to the crossing Saturday to examine it. He said the crossing would be a significant improvement “if it can go to scale and is not temporary.”
After Israeli strikes killed seven aid workers April 1, Biden told Netanyahu by phone that the United States could withhold military support for Israel unless it did more to protect civilians and ensure adequate supplies for Palestinian civilians.
Gallant pledged Wednesday to “flood Gaza with aid” and said he expected to ultimately see 500 relief trucks entering the enclave on a daily basis. U.N. figures show that an average of about 110 aid trucks have entered Gaza daily since the war began Oct. 7.
Gallant also said that Israel would soon open the port of Ashdod, an Israeli city north of Gaza, to accept aid shipments, without providing a time frame.

U.S. Sends Top General to Israel Amid Fears of Iranian Retaliation: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The visit of Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, the U.S. military commander in the Middle East, came as diplomats sought to avert a wider war.
The United States dispatched its top military commander for the Middle East to Israel on Thursday, after President Biden stated that, despite recent friction, American support for Israel "is ironclad" in the event of an attack by Iran.
Iran's leaders have repeatedly vowed to punish Israel for an April 1 strike in Syria that killed several senior Iranian commanders. Israel has put its military on alert, and Mr. Biden said on Wednesday that Iran was threatening a "significant" attack.
Gen. Michael E. Kurilla, the American commander, will coordinate with Israel on what is widely expected to be imminent retaliatory action by Iran and will also discuss the war against Hamas in Gaza and humanitarian aid operations there, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel acknowledged on Thursday that Israel was facing "challenging times," noting that "in the midst of the war in Gaza" his country was "also prepared for scenarios involving challenges in other sectors."
"We have determined a simple rule: Whoever harms us, we will harm them," he said while visiting an air base, using language that has been used in recent days to refer to threats from Iran and its proxies, including Hamas.
Active fighting in Gaza has ebbed to its lowest point since November. Israel withdrew troops from southern Gaza over the weekend but said the military would stay in other parts of the territory to preserve its "freedom of action and its ability to conduct precise intelligence-based operations."
Mr. Netanyahu has said that a date has been set for a ground invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza, where more than a million displaced Palestinians have sought shelter -- an operation U.S. officials have warned would be catastrophic for civilians. Some analysts have suggested that his threats are bluster or attempts at gaining leverage in cease-fire negotiations.
The Biden administration has urged Mr. Netanyahu to shelve the invasion plans and focus on "alternative approaches that would target the key elements of Hamas."
President Biden has become increasingly critical of Mr. Netanyahu's conduct of the war in Gaza, even threatening to condition U.S. assistance on Israel's doing more to protect civilians. But he emphasized on Wednesday that American support for Israel in the face of danger from Iran and its allied militias, like Hezbollah, was unconditional.
"As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad," he said at a news conference.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken also "made clear that the U.S. will stand with Israel against any threats by Iran and its proxies" when he spoke by phone on Wednesday with Israel's defense minister, the State Department said.
In Israel, General Kurilla had carried out a situational assessment and reviewed "regional security challenges" with the Israeli military's chief of staff, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military.
"We are highly alert and ready to face various scenarios," Admiral Hagari said in a televised news briefing, adding that any strike from Iranian territory would be a clear regional escalation.
As Iran and Israel have traded fresh threats in recent days, diplomats have been trying to reduce tensions and avert a wider regional war.
The foreign minister of Germany, Annalena Baerbock, spoke to her Iranian counterpart "about the tense situation" in the Middle East on Thursday, according to her office.
"Avoiding further regional escalation must be in everyone's interest," her office said in a statement. "We urge all actors in the region to act responsibly and exercise maximum restraint."
The diplomatic efforts came as the Israeli military on Thursday announced that it had carried out a new operation that killed at least one member of Hamas in Gaza.
The Israeli military said Thursday that its forces had carried out a "precise, intelligence-based operation" in central Gaza overnight with fighter jets and ground troops to "eliminate terrorist operatives and strike terrorist infrastructure."
"The goal of the operation, of course, is to destroy Hamas's ability to rehabilitate itself in the area," Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for the Israeli military, said in a briefing Thursday evening. "We continue fighting in Gaza and are preparing for future operations."
On Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza killed three sons of Ismail Haniyeh, who leads the political wing of Hamas from exile. Hamas-affiliated media reported that three of Mr. Haniyeh's grandchildren also were killed in the attack.
The Israeli military said the three sons -- Amir, Mohammad and Hazem -- were active in Hamas's military operations, Amir as a cell commander and his brothers as lower-level operatives. One of the brothers was also involved in holding hostages in Gaza, the Israeli military said, without specifying which one. The military did not provide further details, and its claims could not be verified.
The military's emphasis on the precision of the attack announced on Thursday followed accusations that Israeli bombing has been indiscriminate, causing avoidable civilian casualties, and amid rising criticism over impending famine in Gaza.
It also came as international negotiators worked to broker a cease-fire in Gaza and to secure the release of the hostages held in the enclave, in return for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Those talks have stalled over disagreements about the details, with a senior Hamas official saying Wednesday that the group did not have 40 living hostages who met the criteria for an exchange under a proposal being discussed.
While Mr. Haniyeh is one of Hamas's most senior officials, analysts said that his sons were not likely as integral to the group's operations as the Israeli military has suggested.
"His son's names are not usually floated around when you talk about seniority in Hamas, whether it's the political or military wing," said Tahani Mustafa, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, a think tank.
Bilal Saab, an associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, said the strike on the sons might have been intended to placate a domestic audience in Israel or to give the Israelis leverage in the talks.
"It's a political win for Israel more than anything else," Mr. Saab said of the killings.
Mr. Haniyeh said Wednesday that Israel was "delusional if it thinks that by killing my children, we will change our positions" in negotiations.

Full text: A guide to the armed groups that let Iran extend its influence throughout the region.
For years, Iran has been the outsider.
Predominantly Persian-speaking in a region where most people speak Arabic, overwhelmingly Shiite where most are Sunni, it has been crippled by Western sanctions meant to make it a pariah.
Yet Iran has succeeded in projecting its military power across a large swath of the Middle East. Its reach equals -- if not eclipses -- that of traditional power centers like Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
And now, spurred by the war in the Gaza Strip, armed groups that Iran has fostered over the past 45 years have mobilized simultaneously toward similar goals: diminishing Israeli power and confronting Israel's closest ally, the United States.
Iran has tried to capitalize on its outsider position by seeking out disempowered Shiite populations and offering to train and arm them, and by working with the sympathetic government of Syria.
The shadow war between Israel and Iran broke into the open this week, when Israel struck an Iranian Embassy compound in Syria and killed seven Iranian commanders, renewing fears of a broader conflict. Iran has promised to retaliate, but the calculus is tricky: The Iranians want to avoid igniting a full-fledged war that might drag in the United States and threaten the survival of Iran's regime.
Altogether, Iran now supports more than 20 groups in the Middle East, directly or indirectly, with a combination of arms, training and financial aid. The United States has designated them as foreign terrorist organizations, and many of their leaders have been hit by sanctions, as has Tehran.
While they are often lumped together, and they do in fact share many of Iran's goals, these groups also have some purely local interests. And, with a few exceptions, Iran does not completely control them.
Here is a look at the most prominent of the armed groups backed by Iran.
Hamas
A close ally, it gives Tehran a direct link to the Palestinian struggle, a cause that resonates across the Arab world.
Hamas dominates the Palestinian guerrilla fight against Israel that is based in the Gaza enclave, which their political wing took control of in 2007.
Recent actions
On Oct. 7, Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza, killing roughly 1,200 people, including women and children, according to Israeli authorities, and taking more than 200 hostages.
Since its creation in 1987, Hamas has launched numerous strikes on Israel, often working with another Iranian-backed militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In 2021, the two groups fired 4,000 rockets into Israel over an 11-day period.
How they are linked to Iran
U.S. officials do not believe that Iran initiated the Hamas attack or that it had even been informed about it in advance.
But Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad together receive more than $ 100 million a year from Tehran in addition to weapons and training, according to a 2020 U.S. State Department report. In a 2022 interview, Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said Hamas received about $ 70 million a year.
Iran has not just provided weapons and training to both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it has also taught Hamas to make and assemble its own weapons from local supplies.
Although Hamas and other Palestinian groups follow the Sunni branch of Islam and have a different political orientation from Iran, they share antagonism toward Israel and anger over the legacy of Western colonialism.
Iran's outreach to Hamas began in Lebanon in the early 1990s after Israel forced hundreds of Palestinians, including Hamas leaders, to go there. In Lebanon, Hamas adherents quickly forged ties with members of another militia, Hezbollah, Shiite Muslims whose links to Iran were already well established. Through Hezbollah, Hamas became connected to Iran.
At times, however, that relationship has ruptured.
During the Arab Spring of 2011, Hamas backed the anti-government forces in Syria while Iran backed President Bashar al-Assad. And in 2015, Hamas leaned toward supporting Saudi Arabia against the Houthi forces in Yemen favored by Iran.
But since then, there has been a rapprochement both between the Hamas leadership and Mr. Assad, and between Hamas and the Houthis.
Military capabilities
For the most part, Hamas is equipped with comparatively unsophisticated weapons -- but quantity makes up for what the group's arsenal lacks in quality.
Before the war Hamas had thousands of short-range and medium-range rockets that can travel at least 125 miles. From Gaza, some of them can reach as far as the Israeli cities of Eilat and Haifa, as well as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
It also has a large number of Russian-made, portable anti-tank missiles, which the group has used against Israeli troops in Gaza in recent months, according to weapon experts. And it has drones that it has used to attack Israeli tanks and communication nodes.
Within Gaza, Hamas has the ability to manufacture and assemble at least some of these weapons, using parts from Iran, as well as from China and Russia. It is not clear if those countries supplied them or if they were obtained through Iran and Hezbollah.
Hezbollah
The largest, oldest and best-trained Iranian proxy group in the Middle East.
Hezbollah, a Shiite organization, has become the predominant political and military power in Lebanon.
Recent actions
Hezbollah, a longtime antagonist of Israel's, began turning up the pressure on Israel's border after the war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, launching strikes across the border. Israel has counterattacked, and many civilians on both sides of the border have been forced to flee their homes.
The most sustained conflict between Hezbollah and Israel was in 2006. That fight made clear how formidable Hezbollah forces had become, but it took a deep toll on the Lebanese, killing more than a thousand people, mostly civilians, and displacing more than 900,000.
How they are linked to Iran
Hezbollah receives significant financial support from Iran, though the exact amount is hard to ascertain. One U.S. official testifying in 2018 put the amount at $ 700 million, but offered no evidence for that number. However, Iran's cash support for Hezbollah has diminished over time, reflecting the impact of long-term sanctions coupled with the more recent intense sanctions ordered by President Donald J. Trump and maintained by President Biden.
Iran has nevertheless been able to maintain its backing for Hezbollah in many other ways. It continues, for example, to provide not just arms but also sophisticated technological know-how so that Hezbollah engineers can manufacture weapons locally. The ability to produce its own weapons has made Hezbollah into one of the best-supplied militias in the Middle East.
Experts on Iranian military strategy say that Tehran views Hezbollah forces in Lebanon as its first line of defense should Israel attack Iran.
Iran's ties to Hezbollah date to Lebanon's 15-year civil war, which started in 1975. By 1980, Lebanese Shiite Muslims, inspired in part by Iran, had begun an armed struggle against the Israeli military presence in southern Lebanon.
There were many reasons for Iran to aid the fighters, analysts say, but one big one was that doing so presented an opportunity for it to insert itself back into the political fabric of the Arab Middle East. A war with Iraq had left it cut off from much of the region, and especially from Sunni Muslim rulers wary of Iranian leaders.
Military capabilities
Estimates by the U.S. military and arms experts put Hezbollah's arsenal, the largest of the Iranian-linked groups, at about 135,000 to 150,000 rockets and missiles. Others estimate it is even larger. With ranges of up to 200 or so miles, they allow the militants to reach targets deep inside Israel.
Among the weapons, analysts estimate, are between 100 to 400 recently retrofitted missiles with precision-guidance systems that can be programmed to land within meters of their targets. The technology is predominantly Iranian and Russian, though it is sometimes modified by Hezbollah's weapon experts.
Military analysts view Hezbollah's fighting force as more disciplined, better trained and better organized than most Middle East armies. It is made up of about 30,000 troops and 20,000 reservists. And, according to analysts, it has the ability to quickly recruit and train thousands of new foot soldiers through its role as a political power and a social-service provider in many Lebanese communities.
The Houthis
A recent addition to Iran's network of allies, these militants have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route.
The Houthis became the de facto rulers of Yemen after taking control of the capital in 2014. They now control about a third of the country, home to 70 to 80 percent of the population, according to U.S. officials.
Recent actions
A Houthi attack on March 6 in the Red Sea killed three seamen, wounded four others and damaged their Barbados-flagged cargo ship so badly that it sank. Other Houthi strikes have targeted vessels owned by Britain and Greece.
Since the war in Gaza broke out, the Houthis, expressing solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, have launched more than 60 missile and drone strikes on ships transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, according to the Congressional Research Service.
The attacks have affected commerce worldwide. Shipping through the Red Sea and Suez Canal has dropped at least 50 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some industry analysts say the decrease is closer to 80 percent.
Ports in southern Mediterranean countries are feeling the losses most acutely. Houthi missiles have also targeted Israel's southern port of Eilat.
Before the war, the Houthis attacked targets in the United Arab Emirates and in Saudi Arabia.
How they are linked to Iran
For the most part, the Houthis receive weapons and training from Iran instead of direct financial support, but experts say they have also received narcotics, and, in the past, some petroleum products, both of which can be resold, giving the Houthis needed cash. In December 2023, the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on individuals and on money exchanges in Iran, Turkey and Yemen that were involved in transferring millions of dollars from Iran to the Houthis.
The Houthis share Iran's adherence to Shiite Islam as well as its antipathy for Saudi Arabia. During Yemen's civil war, Iran and Hezbollah helped the Houthis fight against both the Yemeni government and its Saudi backers.
Military capabilities
Estimates vary widely on the Houthi militia's manpower and the size of its arsenal.
Experts say it has about 20,000 trained fighters, but in interviews, Houthi leaders have claimed to have as many as 200,000, and in 2015 the United Nations put the number at about 75,000.
What is clear, based on the recent attacks, is that the Houthis have some highly trained units adept at operating increasingly sophisticated drones as well as anti-ship ballistic missiles and missiles intended for stationary targets on land.
Most of the anti-ship missiles and drones have been intercepted by U.S. or British warships or have fallen into the sea without doing damage.
But the Houthis have hit their targets often enough to increase risks and insurance costs, leading many major shippers to avoid the Red Sea route.
The European shipping giants Maersk, based in Denmark, and Hapag-Lloyd, based in Germany, are routing most of their loads around the Cape of Good Hope despite the added delivery time and cost. Those companies continuing to thread their way through the Red Sea are relying primarily on U.S. and European navies for protection.
According to a recent U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report and a United Nations report, many of the Houthis' weapons are either Iranian or variations on Iranian models. They have used ballistic and cruise missiles to hit targets in southern Israel, more than 1,000 miles away.
Most recently, the Houthis have deployed sea drones, some that skim the water and others that travel under the surface. The underwater ones are considered to be relatively advanced weaponry, according to Western intelligence analysts and the U.S. Naval Institute.
Iraqi Armed Groups
Iran has secured far-reaching influence on its neighbor and is a power both in Iraqi politics and in business across most of the country.
For nearly 20 years, Iraq has been a breeding ground for increasingly powerful Shiite militant groups. While they are less known than Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, they have been just as determined to strike U.S. targets.
Four in particular have had a hand in a number of the attacks in recent years: Kata'ib Hezbollah (which is unrelated to Hezbollah in Lebanon), Harakat al Nujaba, Kata'ib Sayyid al Shuhada and Asa'ib Ahl al Haq.
Recent actions
As war flared in Gaza in October, two of those groups turned up their strikes on American positions in Iraq. Kata'ib Hezbollah and Harakat al Nujaba launched 166 attacks on U.S. military installations in Iraq and Syria, according to a Pentagon spokesman.
The early attacks wounded about 70 troops, with most of the injuries relatively minor. On Jan. 28, however, a strike on a resupply base on the Jordanian-Syrian border killed three U.S. troops and wounded more than 34.
How they are linked to Iran
The Iraqi groups' links to Iran go back almost two decades, and over the years Tehran has given them money, weapons and training.
Today, Iran still provides training and weapon parts as well as technical and strategic support. The Shiite groups, however, are now part of the Iraqi government's security apparatus under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which includes more than 35 armed groups. The Iraqi government covers the salaries of most of the rank and file. It is unclear if Iran augments the salaries for commanders and the groups' leadership.
Iran is believed not to dictate the groups' targets or the timing of their attacks, but it does have some sway in persuading them to hold fire.
That is what happened after the deadly strike on the U.S. resupply base in January. Iran reportedly put intense pressure on the groups in Iraq to halt their strikes on U.S. camps and installations. The groups reluctantly agreed, although some continued to carry out occasional attacks in Syria and Israel.
Military capabilities
Kata'ib Hezbollah, which analysts estimate has between 10,000 and 30,000 fighters, uses drones, rockets and missiles with ranges of up to about 700 miles, according to the U.S. Central Command.
With Iran's help, the group has gained the capacity to retrofit missiles to make them more accurate. It also has a variety of attack drones, including ones that can travel up to 450 miles. A drone was used in the attack on the resupply base that killed three American troops.
Harakat al Nujaba and Kata'ib Sayyid al Shuhada have fewer troops -- analysts estimate their troop numbers are closer to 1,000 to 5,000 -- but use similar weapons. They operate primarily in Syria and have attacked Israel.
Syrian Armed Groups
Nowhere has Iran given more resources to a regional government than Syria, which has been at war for over a decade.
Tehran has spread its resources widely, backing armed elements both outside and within the Syrian government. In contrast to Lebanon, where Iran has focused its efforts on a nonstate armed entity, in Syria the support has gone to both government and nongovernmental armed actors.
Two are proxy groups made up of fighters recruited in Iran and entirely controlled by the Quds Force, the external military and intelligence service of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Others are local forces made up of fellow Shiite Muslims, of Sunnis or of a mix of the Sunni, Shiite, Alawite and Christian faiths.
How they are linked to Iran
Iran has helped prop up President Bashar al-Assad in numerous ways, including through billions of dollars in loans to the government, supplies of discounted oil and payments to help sustain Syria's military forces.
The Revolutionary Guards also field at least two militias in Syria: the Fatemiyoun brigade, made up of Afghan refugees, and the Zainebiyoun brigade, made up of Pakistani refugees. They reportedly pay other armed contingents more modest salaries.
Iran's involvement in Syria goes back to just after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, when Syria supported the new government in Tehran as others shunned it. Iran sees Syria as a strategic partner offering it overland access to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Military capabilities
Syria is also where Iranian-backed forces retrofit, manufacture and store weapons that Iran then distributes to armed groups in Syria and around the region, above all Hezbollah. Over the past 12 to 15 years, at Iran's behest, the Syrian government has retooled some of its weapon facilities into production centers for retrofitting midrange rockets and missiles with precision-guidance systems, according to Israeli defense and intelligence reports.
The existence of these sites, some of which are underground for protection, became public in 2022 when an Israeli defense minister, Benny Gantz, spoke out about them after Israel bombed Syria and the strikes set off secondary explosions. The United States has also bombed Iranian weapon stores in Syria.
Syria also has a history of chemical-weapon production dating to the 1970s and of short- and midrange missiles adapted for their delivery, according to French intelligence officials. In 2023, the U.N. Security Council concluded that Syria still had chemical-weapon stores despite numerous international efforts to compel the government to destroy them.

Full text: The Israeli airstrike this week in Damascus that killed seven Iranian commanders was an unusually harsh blow, and officials say Iran is determined to respond, raising fears of a war.
Iran vowed on Friday to avenge Israel's killing of senior commanders and other officers of its elite Quds Force, at a public funeral held for the dead men, elevating fears of open war but leaving unsaid how it would retaliate or when.
U.S. officials in Washington and the Middle East said on Friday that they were bracing for possible Iranian retaliation for the Israeli airstrike on Monday in Damascus, Syria. U.S. military forces in the region have been placed on heightened alert. Israel has also placed its military on high alert, according to an Israeli official, canceled leave for combat units, recalled some reservists to air defense units and blocked GPS signals.
Two Iranian officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly said that Iran had placed all its armed forces on full high alert and that a decision had been made that Iran must respond directly to the Damascus attack to create deterrence.
"Our brave men will punish the Zionist regime," Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, told the crowd in Tehran attending the funeral of the officers killed in Damascus. "We warn that no act by any enemy against our holy system will go unanswered and the art of the Iranian nation is to break the power of empires."
The Israeli airstrike hit a building that was part of the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, killing three generals and four other officers of the Quds Force. The force, an arm of the Revolutionary Guards, conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran, often working closely with allies that oppose Israel and the United States, including Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas.
Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeed Iravani, said on Thursday that he would give interviews to U.S. news outlets "after Iran's response to Israel."
There are precedents for a forceful response by Iran. Four years ago, after the United States killed the chief of the Quds Force, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran fired missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq, injuring more than 100 troops.
Though its proxy militias around the Middle East have launched a number of attacks on Israel since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, Iran has taken care to avoid a direct conflict that could lead to full-fledged war.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, delivered a video speech that was broadcast in Iran and in Lebanon during the funeral, saying that a response from Iran could come any time and that "we must be prepared for all eventualities."
"Be certain that the Iranian response to the targeting in Damascus is inevitably coming," Mr. Nasrallah said.
In the past few months, Israel has killed at least 18 members of the Quds Force, among them four senior commanders who were veterans of Middle East wars, according to Iranian media. But the airstrike in Damascus was far out of the ordinary, both in killing so many senior figures at once and in hitting a diplomatic building, normally considered off limits in conflicts. Israeli officials said the building functioned as a Revolutionary Guards base and so was a legitimate target.
The building housed the official residence of Iran's ambassador to Syria, who said on state television that he and his family had left the building when it was hit.
The final decision on a matter as important as a strike against Israel rests with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is also the commander in chief of the armed forces. It was Mr. Khamenei who ordered the 2020 attack in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani.
U.S. military analysts assess that it is more likely that Iran would strike Israel itself than that it would have its proxies attack U.S. troops in the region, including in Iraq and Syria, as they did more than 170 times in the four months after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault against Israel. Those attacks against American targets stopped in early February, but Pentagon officials said they were watching the situation closely.
An Israeli defense official said that Israeli analysts had reached the same conclusion, that Iran itself would attack and not act through Hezbollah, its closest militant ally, which has been engaging in regular exchanges of fire with Israeli forces since the war began.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, before a security cabinet meeting about a potential Iranian attack, said on Thursday, "We will know how to defend ourselves and we will act according to the simple principle of whoever harms us or plans to harm us -- we will harm them."
Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, the top U.S. Air Force commander in the Middle East, told the Defense Writers Group in Washington this week.: "From a military perspective, the biggest concern that I have is, does this lead to some sort of regional escalation? We're watching very carefully, we're listening to what the Iranians are saying in terms of how they intend to respond."
"I do continue to assess that the Iranians are not interested in a broader regional conflict," he added. "They want to take advantage of the crisis as it exists, but they're not interested in war with Israel, war with the United States or war with anybody else right now."
The funeral ceremony in Tehran on Friday coincided with the annual Quds Day rally, a show of solidarity with Palestinians held on the last Friday of Ramadan in many Muslim countries. The crowd chanted, "Death to Israel," and "Death to America," and waved the Palestinian flag. In videos shown on state news media, an angry crowd stomped on an effigy of Mr. Netanyahu.
The Quds Day rally, held in many cities across Iran, draws families with children and usually has a carnival-like atmosphere. But this year, the event appeared to be more somber, overshadowed by the funeral, the heightened tensions with Israel and fears that a response from Iran could start a war between the two countries.
Iran's president, Ibrahim Raisi, and the commander in chief of the Quds Force, General Ismail Ghaani, who was dressed in black civilian clothes rather than in uniform, marched with the crowd of mourners in Tehran, state media showed. Also present were Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, the leader of the Islamic Palestinian Jihad, and Abu Fadak al-Muhammadawi the head of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, a Shia militia aligned with Iran.
The coffins of the slain Quds Force officers, draped with the flag of Iran and placed on the back of trucks adorned with flowers and green leaves, slowly snaked down a long road in downtown Tehran, where thousands of people had gathered.
The night before, the coffins were taken to the residential compound of Mr. Khamenei, the supreme leader, and laid in an open hall where he performed the Muslim prayer for the dead over them. The ayatollah typically does such honors only for very close associates and senior officials who have been declared "martyrs" because they were killed by Israel or the United States.

Full text: The leaders of Iran and the militia groups it backs around the Middle East made an unusual televised show of unity and defiance on Wednesday, railing against Israel and the United States, as war rages in the Gaza Strip. On a joint broadcast, the leaders of a group that calls itself the Axis of Resistance, speaking from different locations, delivered fiery speeches ahead of the upcoming Quds Day, a show of solidarity with Palestinians held each year on the last Friday of Ramadan. The war between Israel and Hamas gave this year's iteration a sharper edge than usual. The broadcast also came just days after Israel struck an Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, Syria, killing three generals of Iran's Quds Force and four other Iranian officers in one of the deadliest attacks in the yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran. President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran said that Israel would be punished and made to regret its attack in Damascus. He focused most of his speech on what he called Israel's demise in world public opinion and said any normalization of ties with the Jewish state -- referring to Saudi Arabia -- would be akin to "betting on a dead horse." Last April, a similar event took place to commemorate Quds Day, with a broader list of speakers representing political and military leaders from across the Arab world and Iran. This year's event, however, was tightly focused on militant groups supported by Iran that have been fighting Israel on multiple fronts since Hamas's Oct. 7 assault on Israel, which they refer to as Al Aqsa Flood. The speakers, in addition to Mr. Raisi, included Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas; Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese group Hezbollah; Ziad al-Nakhaleh, the leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which, like Hamas, is active in Gaza; Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthi movement, which controls a large part of Yemen; and Hadi al-Ameri, the leader of Hashd al-Shaabi, an Iraqi Shiite militia. "The Al Aqsa Flood united the Muslim people and this collective unity has manifested with the help of Iran on battlefields in Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq," Mr. Haniyeh said. He said that the United States had aided crimes committed by Israel by supporting it financially, providing it with sophisticated weaponry and vetoing cease-fire resolutions at the United Nations Security Council. Since Oct. 7, Hezbollah has launched daily attacks against Israel after a long lull in fighting, raising fears of a wider regional war, and the Houthis for the first time have launched drones and missiles against Israel and vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting international shipping. Iran has tried to calibrate its response, applying pressure on Israel while avoiding all-out war. Earlier this year, it made an effort to rein in Iraqi militias, including Hashd al-Shaabi, that had been firing on U.S. bases. Mr. Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, urged his followers not to "overlook the achievements of the resistance" in six months of battle with Israel. Mr. al-Ameri focused most of his speech on the resolve of militant groups to force the American military to withdraw from Iraq saying, "we are steadfast and there is no turning back." Separate from that broadcast event, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, held a large meeting on Wednesday with government, military and religious leaders of the country, and pledged that Israel would receive "a slap" for killing Iranian officers in Syria. The crowd, fists in the air, chanted back, "Death to Israel."

Full text: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has the challenge of trying to defeat Hamas while preserving both his government and Israel's international alliances.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is facing challenges on multiple fronts, with his domestic support appearing to erode at a time when international fury and frustration over the war in Gaza have reached new heights.
The Israeli leader has come under sharper criticism from allies like the United States as the civilian death toll climbs in Gaza, and the Israeli military's killing there this week of seven aid workers has heightened global anger.
On Thursday, President Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken both suggested that American support for Israel was not unconditional in remarks that laid bare the growing divisions between Washington and Jerusalem.
In a phone call with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Biden called the strikes on relief workers and the broader humanitarian crisis in Gaza "unacceptable," according to a White House statement.
"He made clear the need for Israel to announce and implement a series of specific, concrete and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering and the safety of aid workers," the White House statement said. "He made clear that U.S. policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel's immediate action on these steps."
Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Mr. Blinken said, "With regard to our policy in Gaza, look, I'll just say this: If we don't see the changes that we need to see, there'll be changes in our own policy."
Within hours of the phone call, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council had released a statement announcing that, at Mr. Biden's request, Israel would allow more aid crossings in Gaza. The statement said Israel had agreed to use the Ashdod port to direct aid into Gaza, to open the Erez crossing into northern Gaza for the first time since the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7 and to significantly increase deliveries from Jordan.
At home, Mr. Netanyahu, who has outlasted many predictions of his political demise, has been confronted with protests, divisions within his government and falling approval ratings in opinion polls.
On Wednesday night, Benny Gantz, a former general who is a key member of Mr. Netanyahu's war cabinet, heaped more pressure on the prime minister by calling for early elections. A popular political rival to Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gantz said that elections should be held in September -- just before the one-year mark of the war. (New elections in Israel are not legally required until late October 2026.)
Elections in September "will leave us time to continue the security effort, and it will allow Israeli citizens to know that we will soon need to renew the trust between us," he said at a news conference. "It will prevent the rupture among the people."
Mr. Gantz's remarks, which Israeli news websites featured prominently on Thursday, underscored how government unity since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel was showing signs of strain nearly six months into the war. An opposition leader, Mr. Gantz crossed parliamentary lines after the attack to join the Netanyahu war cabinet as an emergency measure.
Mr. Gantz did not suggest he would quit the war cabinet, and if he were to, that alone would not topple the government; his centrist party is not part of Mr. Netanyahu's far-right governing coalition, which holds 64 seats in the 120-member Parliament. But it would dismantle the emergency wartime leadership team formed after Oct. 7, along with the air of solidarity it created, potentially creating more momentum for new elections.
Mr. Gantz's words echoed the calls of thousands of anti-government protesters who filled the streets outside the Israeli Parliament in Jerusalem this week in a four-day demonstration to demand early elections and Mr. Netanyahu's ouster.
At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu has faced sharp criticism from his far-right coalition partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, over any indication that he is hesitating in the war against Hamas or in the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Unlike Mr. Gantz, they have the power to make the government fall and to force elections by leaving the coalition.
The pressure comes as Biden administration officials are expressing more open frustration with Mr. Netanyahu's prosecution of the war and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
In a tense phone call on Wednesday, the U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd J. Austin III, criticized his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, over the deadly attack on the aid workers, including a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen. According to a Pentagon account of the call, Mr. Austin expressed "outrage" at the attack -- a significant change in tone from their previous calls.
Despite the tough language, the Biden administration did not directly threaten to halt the flow of American munitions to Israel or place conditions on their transfer, as many congressional Democrats are now urging.
"I'm not going to preview any potential policy decisions coming forward," John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. "What we want to see are some real changes on the Israeli side," he said, including a significant increase in humanitarian aid, additional border crossings into Gaza and a reduction in violence against civilians and aid workers.
Israel has called the strike a tragic mistake that resulted from a "misidentification" but has not offered further details.
Another Israeli ally, Britain, is also coming under more pressure to curtail its support for Israel; three of the seven World Central Kitchen workers who were killed were Britons. On Wednesday, more than 600 lawyers and retired judges sent a letter to the British government urging it to suspend weapon sales to Israel, arguing that they violated international law.
The letter cited the risk of famine in Gaza, a planned Israeli military assault on the crowded city of Rafah in southern Gaza and a finding by the U.N.'s top court that there was a "plausible risk" of genocide in Gaza.
Among the signatories were Brenda Hale, a former president of Britain's Supreme Court; Jonathan Sumption and Nicholas Wilson, former justices on the court; and dozens of the country's most prominent lawyers.
The international pressure to suspend military sales to Israel came as the Israeli military said that it was canceling leave for combat units and blocking GPS signals. The Israeli military did not explicitly cite the reason behind the moves, but Israeli newspapers noted that it came amid fears of an increased threat from Iran.
Israeli officials have also suggested that increased cross-border fighting between their forces and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia backed by Iran, could prompt a much larger military response by Israel than it has mounted so far.
Iranian leaders have vowed to punish Israel for killing top Iranian commanders this week in an airstrike in Syria. The attack was one of the deadliest in a decades-long shadow war between the two enemies, and American officials have voiced concerns that it could prompt retaliatory strikes against Israel or the United States.
Israel said on Wednesday night that it had decided to mobilize reserve soldiers for its Aerial Defense unit. On Thursday, it said it was pausing leave for all combat units given "the latest situational assessment."
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a military spokesman, said Israel had also been disrupting GPS signals to intercept any threats.
"During the war, we dealt with a large number of threats launched toward Israel" including missiles and drones, he said at a news briefing on Thursday, adding that "most of them were manufactured in Iran."
As outrage continues to boil over the killing of the aid workers this week, their employer, World Central Kitchen, called for an independent investigation into the attack and asked Australia, Britain, Canada, the United States and Poland, whose citizens were among the victims, to join it in demanding an outside inquiry.
World Central Kitchen also called on Israel to preserve documentation related to the strikes and pushed back on Mr. Netanyahu's assertion that strikes, while "tragic" and unintentional, were something that "happens in war."
"This was a military attack that involved multiple strikes and targeted three W.C.K. vehicles," the statement said. "All three vehicles were carrying civilians; they were marked as W.C.K. vehicles; and their movements were in full compliance with Israeli authorities."

Around 5 p.m. Monday, Israeli warplanes streaked across the Syrian border, striking an embassy building in Damascus and killing a cadre of senior Iranian military commanders with the kind of pinpoint accuracy that has earned Israel’s military fear and respect across the Middle East.
Several hours later, the same Israeli military rained missiles on an aid convoy on a coastal road in the Gaza Strip, a botched operation that left seven foreign aid workers dead and Israel’s reputation in tatters. Its leaders were forced to admit to a string of lethal mistakes and misjudgments.
How one of the world’s best-equipped, best-trained militaries could pull off a dangerous strike on foreign soil and then stumble with such tragic consequences in Gaza raises a raft of hard questions — not least how the Israeli military enforces the rules of engagement in its war against Hamas.
Israeli officials attribute the strike on the aid group, World Central Kitchen, to factors common in war: a complex battlefield, where combatants mix with civilians; reduced visibility because it was nighttime; and a moving target, which gave the commanders only minutes to make decisions.
The Damascus raid was the mirror image: a meticulously planned, precisely timed operation against a stationary target, most likely approved at the highest levels of the Israeli military and government.
Details provided by members of Iran’s own Revolutionary Guard suggest Israel had intelligence up to the minute of the strike, including when the ambassador and other civilians had left the building and that key Iranian commanders were there to meet Palestinian militants to discuss the war in Gaza.
In contrast, military analysts in Israel and the United States said Israel’s explanations do not fully account for what happened along the Gaza coast Monday night. The accidental killing of the aid workers, several said, was the predictable result of a shoot-first style of engagement Israeli troops have used in their military campaign since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7.
“It was not a question of accuracy because it was highly accurate,” said Yagil Levy, a professor and expert on the Israeli military at the Open University of Israel. “It was not a question of negligence, because the action was taken after close consideration of the circumstances.”
“In Gaza, the IDF is committed to killing as many Hamas fighters as possible,” he continued, using an acronym for the Israeli military. “In many cases, targeting Hamas combatants is at odds with the principle of respecting the immunity of civilians.”
Levy said aid convoys in Hamas-controlled Gaza were often guided by armed locals with ties to the militants to prevent their supplies from being damaged or stolen. For the Israeli military, which uses drones to monitor the convoys, that raises the prospect that some of the passengers constitute legitimate combat targets.
The Israelis struck the World Central Kitchen convoy after it had delivered supplies from a jetty to a warehouse. The three vehicles were traveling back when the Israeli military launched three strikes. Two of the vehicles were destroyed, and a third had a gaping hole in its roof next to the seal that identified it as belonging to World Central Kitchen, the charity founded by chef José Andrés.
Andrés said the military would have known his workers’ locations because it was in communication with them. “This was not just a bad-luck situation where, ‘oops,’ we dropped the bomb in the wrong place,” he said to Reuters.
“It was a mistake that followed a misidentification, at night during the war in a very complex condition,” the Israeli military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Tuesday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed, “We will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.”
Some likened the episode to an errant U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan in 2022 that killed 10 innocent people, including seven children. As in Gaza, that strike was based on aerial video imagery. It came after a suicide bombing killed at least 182 people, including 13 U.S. troops, during the frantic U.S. withdrawal from the country.
Under acute pressure to avert another attack, the U.S. military believed it was tracking a terrorist who might imminently detonate another bomb. Instead, it killed an Afghan aid worker and nine members of his family.
“We had just lost troops to a bomb, and there was fear of another bomb,” said John Nagl, a professor of war-fighting studies at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. “The Israelis felt their troops were in danger. The desire to protect the troops overrode the decision to protect civilians.”
By contrast, Nagl said, the strike on the embassy in Damascus was “flawlessly executed.” The Israelis, he said, “controlled the time and place of the action, and it was on a fixed site. The hard part of that mission was the intelligence gathering, not the military operation.”
Israel still faces international repercussions from the strike, which inflicted serious damage on Iran’s Quds Force, the external military and intelligence service of the Revolutionary Guard. Syria and Iran both expressed outrage, while U.S. officials voiced fears that it could prompt retaliatory strikes against Israel or its ally, the United States.
The botched raid in Gaza, however, has brought a global wave of opprobrium on Israel, which was already becoming more diplomatically isolated. In Britain, the family of one of the killed aid workers, John Chapman, said in a statement, “He died trying to help people and was subject to an inhumane act.”
This is not the first time Israeli soldiers have accidentally hit civilians. In December, they mistakenly shot dead three Israeli hostages in Gaza City, causing outrage in Israel. In January, an Israeli tank opened fire on a convoy for Paltel, the largest telecommunications company in Gaza, killing two technicians, according to the company. The Israeli army said it was investigating the incident but has not announced any conclusions.
Those accidents only add to the pressure facing Israel in light of the spiraling death toll in Gaza. According to health officials in the Hamas-controlled enclave, more than 32,000 people have been killed in six months of war, many of them children. The Gaza Health Ministry’s tally includes both civilians and combatants.
Nagl said he believed the Israeli military should tighten its rules of engagement — the conditions under which soldiers are permitted to open fire — particularly because the number of Hamas fighters in the civilian population had declined since the fighting began in October. Israeli experts said the Israeli military should learn how to better identify targets.
“Tens of thousands of targets have been successfully identified,” said Michael B. Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States who once served as a spokesperson for the Israeli military. “The WCK workers, tragically, weren’t. The IDF will investigate, conclude how and why the error occurred and draw lessons that will help prevent similar errors in the future.”
But Oren and other Israelis pushed back on the suggestion that the Damascus raid was a useful comparison.
“Outside of Gaza — in Syria, for example — Israel faces far fewer complexities,” he said. “Targets are much more easily identified and eliminated, with far less scope for human error.”
Uzi Arad, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu who is now a critic, also rejected the comparison, saying the “sheer intensity” of the fighting in Gaza had even led Israeli soldiers to open fire on each other. “Mistakes happen,” he said. “The situation is changing all the time; it’s not static. It’s very dynamic.”
Arad, who is also a former official in Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, said everything should be done to prevent such errors, but he suggested that they were inescapable on a battlefield like Gaza.
Amos Harel, a military affairs columnist for the Israeli paper Haaretz, acknowledged the challenges of fighting a war in Gaza, but he said the deadly strikes on the convoy were also simply a result of attrition.
“After fighting for such a long time, you get more of these mistakes and problems,” Harel said. “It’s not justified in any way, but it’s the price of ongoing war under these extreme circumstances.”

Syria Attack Earns Israel Rebukes At the U.N.: [Live Blog Post]

Full text: The Russian ambassador accused Washington and Paris of using a double standard.
In an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, the majority of diplomats condemned Israel, saying that it had violated international laws and breached the U.N. charter that protects diplomatic premises when it bombed an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.
The United States, France and Britain did not condemn Israel, but they joined other nations in reiterating that diplomatic structures should be considered off limits during wartime and that the airstrikes, on Monday in Damascus, the Syrian capital, had risked plunging the Middle East into further instability.
"Any miscalculation could lead to broader conflict in an already volatile region, with devastating consequences for civilians who are already seeing unprecedented suffering," Khaled Khiari, the U.N. assistant secretary general, told the Council.
Russia, a close ally of Iran, had called for the meeting to discuss Israel's attack, after Iran's mission to the U.N. submitted a letter to the world body arguing that the airstrikes had violated international law. The attacks killed seven members of Iran's Quds forces, including three generals.
Iran and Syria both attended the meeting and addressed the Council. Israel, which did not attend the meeting, has said that the target was not a diplomatic one because it had been used frequently by Iran's military commanders and personnel in Syria.
Robert A. Wood, the U.S. representative at the meeting, told the Council that Washington had communicated to Iran that it was not involved in the attack and had no prior knowledge of it. Mr. Wood did not directly criticize Israel, saying instead that the United States was concerned about Iran and its proxy militia's use of Syrian territory to attack Israeli targets and American bases.
"Any confirmed attack on property that was in fact a diplomatic facility would be of concern to the United States," Mr. Wood said. "Diplomatic missions and their property, as well as official diplomatic residents, must be protected even in and especially in terms of armed conflict."
Russia's ambassador to the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, said his country was extremely concerned by what he called Israel's disregard of international rules, and described the attacks as "reckless actions." Mr. Nebenzya also lashed out at the United States, Britain and France for their "verbal gymnastics" in applying double standards by refusing to directly criticize Israel.
"If it was your embassy that was attacked or your consulate in the region, would you respond in the same way?" Mr. Nebenzya said. "This is your rules-based order in all its glory."
Geng Shuang, China's deputy ambassador to the U.N, said Israel's attack was "of an extremely vicious nature" and violated the sovereignty of both Syria and Iran. China is a key economic partner for Iran and helps the government stay afloat financially by buying its embargoed oil at a discount price.
Iran's deputy ambassador to the U.N., Zahra Ershadi, said Iran had so far exercised "considerable restraint" but that there was a limit to its patience. Ms. Ershadi called for the Council to hold Israel accountable and take actions against it.
Syria's ambassador to the U.N., Koussay Aldahhak, said the Iranian diplomatic compound was in a densely populated civilian area in Damascus and near buildings that house diplomatic missions, banks, other international agencies, such as the World Food Program, a private hospital and faculty of Damascus University.
"This vital area is crossed by thousands of civilians on daily basis," Mr. Aldahhak said. "Some of those civilians have suffered severe injuries."

Full text: The regional rivals have for decades targeted each other's interests, including with a recent strike in Syria that killed three Iranian commanders. Here are some other notable flash points.
For decades, Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war across the Middle East, trading attacks by land, sea, air and in cyberspace.
Iran has largely used foreign proxies to strike Israeli interests, while targeted assassinations of Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists have been a key part of Israel's strategy.
Israel's strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that killed three top Iranian commanders on Monday was the most brazen attack in years, raising fears of a wider confrontation. That would be particularly dangerous in a region already in turmoil on multiple fronts, including Israel's war in Gaza, cross-border skirmishes between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and attacks by Yemen's Houthi militia against Western interests in the Red Sea. An escalation between Israel and Iran would also risk further entangling the United States, given the presence of American troops in the region.
Here are some key moments in the yearslong conflict.
January 2020: A major target
The assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, commander of the foreign-facing arm of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in an American drone strike in Baghdad was greeted with satisfaction in Israel.
Iran hit back by attacking two bases in Iraq that housed American troops with a barrage of missiles, injuring about 100 U.S. military personnel.
American officials accused General Suleimani of causing the deaths of hundreds of soldiers during the Iraq war. They also said that he was behind destabilizing Iranian activities throughout the Middle East and that he was accused of plotting attacks against U.S. embassies and Israeli targets.
The general had built a network of allied militias to defend Iran's interests across the Middle East and to counter the United States and Israel.
October 2023: Tit-for-tat strikes before Oct. 7
Iran and Israel reportedly carried out a number of covert attacks and counterattacks in the years following General Suleimani's death.
Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in November 2021, and followed up with the assassination of a Revolutionary Guards commander, Col. Sayad Khodayee, in May 2022.
In July 2021, an oil tanker managed by an Israeli-owned shipping company was attacked off the coast of Oman, killing two crew members, according to the company and three Israeli officials.
Two of the officials said that the attack appeared to have been carried out by several Iranian drones that crashed into living quarters underneath the ship's bridge. Iran did not explicitly claim or deny responsibility, but a state-owned TV channel described the attack on the ship as a response to an Israeli strike in Syria.
Once Israel's bombardment of Gaza began after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, Iranian-backed militias stepped up their attacks.
December 2023: Another high-profile killing
At the end of last year, Iran accused Israel of killing a high-level military figure, Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a missile strike outside Damascus. A senior adviser to the Revolutionary Guards, General Mousavi was described as having been a close associate of General Suleimani and was said to have helped oversee the shipment of arms to Hezbollah.
Israel, adopting its customary stance, declined to comment directly on whether it was behind General Mousavi's death.
January 2024: Back-and-forth attacks ratchet up
The Pentagon launched a drone strike in Baghdad that killed a senior figure in an Iran-linked militant group.
The attack came days after an explosion in a suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, that killed Saleh al-Arouri, a Hamas leader, along with two commanders from that group's armed wing. The blast was the first such assassination of a top Hamas official outside the West Bank and Gaza in recent years.
Officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States ascribed the attack to Israel, which did not publicly confirm involvement.
Mr. al-Arouri was the most senior Hamas figure to be killed since Israel vowed to destroy the organization after Oct. 7.
Hezbollah, which receives major support from Iran, stepped up its assaults on Israel after Mr. al-Arouri's death. Israel's military hit back at Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing a number of the group's commanders.
Later in January, Iran accused Israel of launching an airstrike on Damascus. A number of senior Iranian military figures were killed, including the head of intelligence in Syria for the overseas arm of the Revolutionary Guards and his deputy, according to the Iranian news media and an Israeli defense official.
Then, a drone strike by an Iran-backed militia killed three American service members and injured at least 34 others in Jordan. Ten days later, U.S. forces launched a retaliatory drone strike in Baghdad that killed a senior militia leader that U.S. officials blamed for the attacks on American personnel.
February 2024: Further strikes by Israel
The United States' retaliatory airstrikes against Iran-backed militias appeared to temper Tehran's actions.
Israel was blamed for a number of attacks in Syria and Lebanon. In February, Syrian state news media said Israel was behind an airstrike on a residential building in Damascus that killed two people.
The Israeli military declined to comment on that strike, though it has acknowledged hundreds of past strikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria.
But the Israeli military did acknowledge a strike in southern Lebanon in February that it said killed a Hezbollah commander, and in March, it killed a senior Hamas operative in an airstrike also in southern Lebanon.
March 2024: A tense atmosphere
An Israeli drone strike targeted a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person. Israel's military said it had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of a man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, but did not provide further details.
The same day, airstrikes killed soldiers near Aleppo, northern Syria, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
Those strikes killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iran militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war.
Israel's military did not claim responsibility. However, the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, wrote on social media, "We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks."
Three days later, on Monday evening, Israeli warplanes struck the building in Damascus in the attack that killed the three top Iranian commanders.

Full text: Tehran promises major retaliation, and the danger of a miscalculation is ever-present. But neither side wants a major shooting war, given the stakes.
Israel's bombing of an Iranian Embassy building in Damascus, which killed senior Iranian military and intelligence officials, is a major escalation of what has long been a simmering undeclared war between Israel and Iran.
Iran promises major retaliation, and the danger of a miscalculation is ever-present. But given the stakes for both countries, neither Israel nor Iran wants a major shooting war, even as they press for advantage in Gaza and southern Lebanon.
Instead, the strike is a vivid demonstration of the regional nature of the conflict as Israel tries to diminish and deter Iran's allies and surrogates that threaten Israel's security from every direction.
It is often called "the war between the wars," with Israel and Iran as the main adversaries, sparring in the shadows of the more evident hostilities around the region.
The Iranian officials who were killed Monday had been deeply engaged for decades in arming and guiding proxy forces in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen as part of Iran's clearly stated effort to destabilize and even destroy the Jewish state.
For Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who presumably approved such a sensitive attack, the successful elimination of such key Iranian military figures is a political coup. It comes at a time when demonstrations calling for his resignation have increased in intensity, as the war against Hamas drags on and Israeli hostages remain in Gaza.
Displaying its ability to infiltrate Iranian intelligence, Israel is trying to hit the operational part of Iran's regional proxies, its so-called Axis of Resistance to Israel, aiming to disrupt and deter them, even as the war in Gaza continues.
Since the war began in October, Israel has begun to target key Iranian officials responsible for relations with its proxies, not just the advanced weapons Tehran delivers, said Ali Vaez, Iran project director for the International Crisis Group.
But no matter how many experienced generals Israel eliminates, "no one is irreplaceable in the Iranian system," he said. "Iran knows this is a perilous game and there is a price tag attached."
Some worry that price may be borne by Israeli allies. Ralph Goff, a former senior C.I.A. official who served in the Middle East, called Israel's strike "incredibly reckless," adding that "the Israelis are writing checks that U.S. CentCom forces will have to cash," referring to the U.S. military's Central Command.
"It will only result in escalation by Iran and its proxies, which is very dangerous" to U.S. forces in the region who could be targeted in retaliatory strikes by Tehran's proxies, Mr. Goff said.
Mr. Netanyahu has emphasized for years that Israel's main enemy is Iran and the strike could help him "rehabilitate his reputation as 'Mr. Security,"' said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. Even so, it may not be enough, she said, with Israel bogged down in Gaza, Hamas so far unbeaten and Iran and its proxies undiminished.
Iran has vowed retaliation and revenge for what it called an unprecedented attack, but, since Oct. 7, "Iran has been clear that it does not want a regional war," Ms. Vakil said. "It sees this conflict with Israel playing out over a longer time frame."
U.S. officials do not believe that Iran initiated the Hamas attack or was even informed about it in advance. Yet Iran still sees Gaza as "a victory for them, because it isolates Israel and puts it on the defensive in the region and the world," said Suzanne Maloney, director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.
The ongoing war and its civilian toll make it "almost inconceivable to create a vision of the Mideast that Israel and the U.S. and the Saudis were hoping to engineer before Oct. 7," she said, one of regional recognition of Israel by Arab nations opposed to Iran's growing influence.
Still, Ms. Vakil said, "this strike will be difficult for Iran to ignore," since "it is a direct attack on its territory," an embassy building, and killed three senior commanders of Iran's Quds Force, the external military and intelligence service of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Iran said the Israeli strike killed an Iranian general, Mohammad Reza Zahedi, along with his deputy, a third general and at least four other people, reportedly including senior officials of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an Iranian affiliate that is also fighting in Gaza.
The killing of General Zahedi, who was said to be in charge of Iran's military relationship with Syria and Lebanon, is widely considered the most important assassination of an Iranian leader in years.
Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, called the death of General Zahedi "an enormous blow to Iran's immediate capabilities in the region." He had helped oversee Iran's attempt to build a "ring of fire" around Israel via its militant proxies while keeping Tehran's involvement at arm's length, Mr. Amidror said.
But how and when Iran chooses to retaliate will further raise the stakes. The most obvious recent example is its response to the assassination four years ago by the United States of Qassim Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force. Then, Iran launched a major missile attack against an American base in Iraq, but only after warning of the attack in advance. There were no immediate U.S. casualties, though more than 100 military personnel suffered traumatic brain injuries, the Pentagon later said.
An anxious Iran, on high military alert, also shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing 176 people, believing it to be an enemy plane.
"But one of the lessons from Suleimani is that even if you take out someone critical, the network and the redundancy Iran has established with the groups survives quite well," Ms. Maloney said.
Recently Iran has tried to de-escalate the tensions in its relationship with the United States after a January drone attack on a U.S. military base on the Jordanian-Syrian border killed three American soldiers.
But Iran may be more willing to risk a military escalation with Israel.
It could make other choices -- a major cyberattack on Israeli infrastructure or its military, a barrage of rockets from southern Lebanon, a similar assassination of an Israeli commander, an attack on an Israeli embassy abroad, or another sharp acceleration of its nuclear-enrichment program.
The last would be a kind of direct riposte to Mr. Netanyahu, who has long warned about the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran and vowed to prevent it from happening. (Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is purely peaceful, even as it has enriched uranium to close to weapons grade.)
Or Iran could bide its time. Mr. Amidror, the former Israeli national security adviser, said he doubted the strike would lead to a broader escalation between Israel and Iran, such as an all-out war involving Hezbollah along Israel's northern border.
"Their interests haven't changed in the aftermath. They'll look for revenge, but that's something else entirely," he said, and it does not have to be limited to the immediate region.
One previous example he cited was the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires by Islamic Jihad, which killed 29 people and came in response to Israel's assassination of the Hezbollah leader Abbas al-Musawi.

Full text: The airstrike on an Iranian Embassy building was one of the biggest attacks yet in a shadow war that has increasingly been moving into the open.
At least three senior commanders and four officers overseeing Iran's covert operations in the Middle East were killed on Monday when Israeli warplanes struck a building in Damascus that is part of the Iranian Embassy complex, according to Iranian and Syrian officials.
The strike in Damascus, the Syrian capital, appeared to be among the deadliest attacks in a yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran that has included the assassinations of Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists.
That covert war has moved into the open as tensions between the countries have intensified over Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, the Iranian-backed militia that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
Four Israeli officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, confirmed that Israel had been behind the strike in Damascus, but denied that the building had diplomatic status.
But the Syrian ambassador to Iran, Shafiq Dayoub, said the strike had targeted a diplomatic building and was a "clear and complete violation of all international conventions and norms."
Video circulating on social media after the strike showed a destroyed building next to the embassy, and photographs showed an entrance gate with a sign identifying it as the consular section. The embassy said on X that the building housed a consular section and the ambassador's residence.
Footage broadcast by Iranian and Syrian news agencies showed a ruined building, burned cars, shattered glass and debris on the ground.
The dead included Gen. Mohamad Reza Zahedi, 65, who oversaw Iran's covert military operations in Syria and Lebanon, two other generals and four officers in the Quds Force, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said in a statement.
Ali Vaez, the Iran director for the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that seeks to prevent wars, said that targeting a diplomatic facility would be "akin to targeting Iran on its own soil."
Israeli officials said the building was an outpost of the Revolutionary Guards, making it a legitimate military target.
Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, strongly condemned the strike and said he had spoken to his Syrian counterpart about the "Zionist regime's attack on the consulate section of the Islamic Republic's embassy in Damascus."
"Netanyahu has lost his mental balance because he has faced back-to-back defeat in Gaza and has not achieved the Zionists' ambitious goals," Mr. Amir Abdollahian said in a statement, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
In Washington, officials expressed fears that the strike could escalate hostilities in the region. After the strike, American troops based in southern Syria knocked down a one-way attack drone, a U.S. Defense Department official said on Monday night.
It was the first attack aimed at U.S. troops in Iraq or Syria in nearly two months. No injuries or damage were reported, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Damascus strike came as Israeli soldiers withdrew from Gaza's largest hospital complex, Al-Shifa, leaving it badly battered after a two-week raid in which the Israeli military said it had killed about 200 Palestinian militants and arrested hundreds of others after extended firefights.
Dr. Taysir al-Tanna, a longtime vascular surgeon at the Gaza City hospital, said that many of the main buildings -- including the emergency, obstetrics and surgical wards -- had been badly damaged in the fighting and the main gate smashed.
"Now it looks like a wasteland," Dr. al-Tanna said.
Osama al-Ashi, a Gazan who went to the area to check on his apartment after hearing that the Israeli military had withdrawn, said that he was immediately struck by the stench of decomposing bodies and that he had seen mountains of rubble and burned buildings.
"The whole time we were walking," he said, "we were stepping on body parts."
Mr. al-Ashi said that many of the dead appeared to have been shot. Others, he said, appeared to have been unearthed when Israeli forces bulldozed temporary cemeteries on hospital grounds. Many buildings around the hospital had been destroyed by bombs, missiles and tank shells, he said.
"The scenes there were difficult to tolerate as a human being," he said. "You feel like you are in a horror movie."
The Israeli military said that the Palestinians killed had been militants and that those who were arrested had been suspected militants, including some believed to be senior commanders of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It said two Israeli soldiers had been killed and eight others wounded in the raid.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, blamed militants for the destruction at the hospital, saying they had fortified themselves in hospital wards, fired on soldiers and refused calls to surrender.
"We had to fire on the buildings in order to stop that and to kill the terrorists," he said.
Israeli forces evacuated displaced civilians sheltering at the compound, as well as some patients, and placed other patients in a building away from the fighting, Admiral Hagari said.
The World Health Organization said on Sunday that at least 21 patients had died since the Israeli raid began in mid-March, though the causes of death were unclear. By this weekend, 107 patients remained -- 30 of them bedridden -- without drinking water and with only minimal medication, the Gazan Health Ministry said in a statement.
Israeli forces first raided Al-Shifa in November, maintaining that Hamas militants had built a command center in tunnels underneath it. Hamas and the hospital director said the facility was solely used as a refuge for civilians.
The Israeli military later publicized some evidence to support its case, including by showing reporters a fortified tunnel constructed underneath the hospital grounds. An investigation by The New York Times found that the evidence suggested that Hamas had used the site for cover and stored weapons there.
After little more than a week, Israeli troops withdrew in compliance with a brief cease-fire. But after the fighting resumed, Israeli forces closed in on the hospital again in March in an attempt to root out what they said was a renewed insurgency by armed groups in northern Gaza.
"Hamas and Islamic Jihad have started to rebuild themselves in the north," said Admiral Hagari. "And they re-based themselves inside Shifa."
Hamas called the destruction at the hospital "a horrific crime" and said Israel had perpetrated it "with full and unlimited support from the administration of U.S. President Biden."
In a visit to Al-Shifa on Saturday, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, declared the raid "extremely successful" and said it had showed militant groups that "a hospital is not a safe place" for them.
Israeli officials and a member of the Revolutionary Guards, which oversee the Quds Force, said the Damascus strike on Monday had targeted a meeting in which Iranian intelligence officials and Palestinian militants were to discuss the war in Gaza. Among them were leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group armed and funded by Iran.
Syria's defense ministry said the Israeli strike occurred about 5 p.m. local time, when fighter jets entered Syria from the Golan Heights.
The attack came days after airstrikes killed soldiers near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, Syria's state news media and an independent organization reported, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
Those strikes on Friday killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iranian militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war.
Israel's military did not comment after those strikes, but its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said, "We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates, and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks." He promised more operations in Lebanon, Syria and "other more distant locations."
The U.S. Defense Department official did not say who was behind the drone attack Monday on Al Tanf base in southern Syria. Iran-backed militias have fired rockets, missiles and drones at U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria more than 170 times since November, but none since early February.
Three U.S. service members were killed in Jordan, and at least 34 others injured, in a Jan. 28 drone attack by an Iran-backed militia, the first known American military fatalities from hostile fire in the turmoil spilling over from Israel's war with Hamas.
Ten days later, a U.S. Special Operations retaliatory drone strike in Baghdad killed a senior leader of a militia that American officials blame for the attacks on American personnel.

At least three senior commanders and four officers overseeing Iran’s covert operations in the Middle East were killed Monday when Israeli warplanes struck a building in Damascus, Syria, that is part of the Iranian Embassy complex, according to Iranian and Syrian officials.
The strike in Damascus, the Syrian capital, appeared to be among the deadliest attacks in a yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran that has included the assassinations of Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists.
That covert war has moved into the open as tensions between the countries have intensified over Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, the Iranian-backed militia that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
Four Israeli officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, confirmed that Israel had been behind the strike in Damascus, but denied that the building had diplomatic status.
But the Syrian ambassador to Iran, Shafiq Dayoub, said the strike had targeted a diplomatic building and was a “clear and complete violation of all international conventions and norms.”
Video circulating on social media after the strike showed a destroyed building next to the embassy, and photographs showed an entrance gate with a sign identifying it as the consular section. The embassy said on X, formerly Twitter, that the building housed a consular section and the ambassador’s residence.
Footage broadcast by Iranian and Syrian news agencies showed a ruined building, burned cars, shattered glass and debris on the ground.
The dead included Gen. Ali Reza Zahdi, 65, who oversaw Iran’s covert military operations in Syria and Lebanon, two other generals and four officers in the Quds Force, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said in a statement.
Ali Vaez, the Iran director for the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that seeks to prevent wars, said that targeting a diplomatic facility would be “akin to targeting Iran on its own soil.”
Israeli officials said the building was an outpost of the Revolutionary Guard, making it a legitimate military target.
Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, strongly condemned the strike and said he had spoken to his Syrian counterpart about the “Zionist regime’s attack on the consulate section of the Islamic Republic’s embassy in Damascus.”
“Netanyahu has lost his mental balance because he has faced back-to-back defeat in Gaza and has not achieved the Zionists’ ambitious goals,” Amirabdollahian said in a statement, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The strike came as Israeli soldiers withdrew from Gaza’s largest hospital complex, Shifa, leaving it badly battered after a two-week raid in which the Israeli military said it had killed about 200 Palestinian militants and arrested hundreds of others after extended firefights.
Dr. Taysir al-Tanna, a longtime vascular surgeon at the Gaza City hospital, said that many of the main buildings — including the emergency, obstetrics and surgical wards — had been badly damaged in the fighting and the main gate smashed.
“Now it looks like a wasteland,” al-Tanna said.
Osama al-Ashi, a Gaza resident who went to the area to check on his apartment after hearing that the Israeli military had withdrawn, said that he was immediately struck by the stench of decomposing bodies and that he had seen mountains of rubble and burned buildings.
“The whole time we were walking,” he said, “we were stepping on body parts.”
Al-Ashi said that many of the dead appeared to have been shot. Others, he said, appeared to have been unearthed when Israeli forces bulldozed temporary cemeteries on hospital grounds. Many buildings around the hospital had been destroyed by bombs, missiles and tank shells, he said.
“The scenes there were difficult to tolerate as a human being,” he said. “You feel like you are in a horror movie.”
The Israeli military said the Palestinians killed had been militants and that those who were arrested had been suspected militants, including some believed to be senior commanders of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It said two Israeli soldiers had been killed and eight others wounded in the raid.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, blamed militants for the destruction at the hospital, saying they had fortified themselves in hospital wards, fired on soldiers and refused calls to surrender.
“We had to fire on the buildings in order to stop that and to kill the terrorists,” he said.
Israeli forces evacuated displaced civilians sheltering at the compound, as well as some patients, and placed other patients in a building away from the fighting, Hagari said.
The World Health Organization said Sunday that at least 21 patients had died since the Israeli raid began in mid-March, though the causes of death were unclear. By this weekend, 107 patients remained — 30 of them bedridden — without drinking water and with only minimal medication, the Gaza Health Ministry said in a statement.
Israeli forces first raided Shifa in November, maintaining that Hamas militants had built a command center in tunnels underneath it. Hamas and the hospital director said the facility was solely used as a refuge for civilians.
The Israeli military later publicized some evidence to support its case, including by showing reporters a fortified tunnel constructed underneath the hospital grounds. An investigation by The New York Times found that the evidence suggested that Hamas had used the site for cover and stored weapons there.
After little more than a week, Israeli troops withdrew in compliance with a brief cease-fire. But after the fighting resumed, Israeli forces closed in on the hospital again in March in an attempt to root out what they said was a renewed insurgency by armed groups in northern Gaza.
“Hamas and Islamic Jihad have started to rebuild themselves in the north,” said Hagari. “And they re-based themselves inside Shifa.”
Hamas called the destruction at the hospital “a horrific crime” and said Israel had perpetrated it “with full and unlimited support from the administration of U.S. President Biden.”
In a visit to Shifa on Saturday, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, declared the raid “extremely successful” and said it had showed militant groups that “a hospital is not a safe place” for them.
Israeli officials and a member of the Revolutionary Guard, which oversee the Quds Force, said the Damascus strike Monday had targeted a meeting in which Iranian intelligence officials and Palestinian militants were to discuss the war in Gaza. Among them were leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group armed and funded by Iran.
Syria’s defense ministry said the Israeli strike occurred about 5 p.m. local time, when fighter jets entered Syria from the Golan Heights.
The attack came days after airstrikes killed soldiers near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, Syria’s state news media and an independent organization reported, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
Those strikes Friday killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iranian militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria’s civil war.
Israel’s military did not comment after those strikes, but its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said, “We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates, and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.” He promised more operations in Lebanon, Syria and “other more distant locations.”
